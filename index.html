                  <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that each student has the ability to understand and the desire to learn.  They need an environment where they feel safe and comfortable.  As a teacher, I believe that I am responsible for engaging my students and getting them involved in their own education.  It is important to respect the differences of each student; cultural, racial, and each student‚Äôs learning style.  Students have to be given space to discover and develop their own ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  John Dewey states ‚Äúthe teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of proper social life.‚Äù (1897, p. 80).  At the end of a student‚Äôs education they are supposed to be equipped with all the skills and knowledge they need to be successful.  They not only need have information to help them succeed in a career, but also know how to interact with others, handle stress, and how to analyze what they observe everyday.  Students will watch television and accept that the world is the way the actors, and story portray.  They never question what they see, read, or hear.  Students need to be encouraged to question what they are taught; they need to be encouraged to seek explanations.  They need to be instructed on how to raise these challenges while still being respectful of others and listen to differing opinions on a topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Success of a student will also come from identifying interests and using them to make education relatable.   A teacher can help a student develop an interest in their education if the topic can be related directly to their lives.  Getting a student interested is only half of what a teacher has to do to help them learn.  A teacher needs to identify how each student learns best and how the class learns together.  Teachers need to be able to base their activities on students and their learning skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that a teacher has to be flexible with their activities and teaching style.  If a teacher gets too comfortable in their way of presentation, or thinks they know the best way to learn their subject, the students may suffer.  For example, if a history teacher believes that the best way to learn history is by reading the text book, copying the text, and copying notes from a presentation and that is the only way they teach; the students may be bored and not pay full attention.  Teachers need to make their subjects exciting and have their students participate if they want them to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When students participate in activities they can have ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moments; moments of discovery and clarity.  Interactions with their peers will allow them to explain an idea or have one explained from a perspective other than the teacher‚Äôs.  If a teacher does not allow the students to discuss and discover they will not remember the subject after the test.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that a teacher needs to be flexible, patient, understanding, open-minded and, most importantly, unbiased.  I believe that a classroom needs to be an environment where judgement does not take place and the students can voice their ideas or frustrations.  I believe that students need to be educated in both academics and social skills.  It is the job of the teacher to respect their students‚Äô differences and similarities and to help them grow and improve.  A teacher also has to be constantly improving themselves by learning new theories and new ways to help their students.  Being a teacher means constantly improving yourself and your students so that everyone can succeed in reaching their full potential.

                  <h3>Differences in the Classroom</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a teaching candidate at Northeastern Illinois University I have been introduced to many issues that change the learning environment such as political agendas or cultural clashes.  Each student has a unique background, their own way of learning, and their own bank of prior knowledge.  The university has a list of six proficiencies that I will address and demonstrate my progress with each proficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When students enter a classroom, they bring their cultural beliefs, races, and traditions with them.  Each culture has different values and emphasizes different traits in an individual.  For example, in eastern Asia group betterment is valued and individualism is frowned upon where in the United States we encourage individual merit and reward it.  Being aware of these differences between the students and incorporating the student cultures will give all students a chance to learn about a different perspective from their own.  I will help my students to understand that everyone is allowed to have their own opinion and that they should not be discriminated against because of their beliefs, race, or ethnicity.  The first artifact in my portfolio contains the pages of a website I helped create with a group of classmates.  It is about a book called Holler if You Hear Me by Gregory Michie that discusses incorporating students‚Äô cultures and backgrounds into the classroom and making learning meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my own course work I have had the unique experience of making friends with classmates that come from communities very different from my own.  I am from the suburbs where we had everything we needed, the classrooms were well stocked, and I had many options in terms of the courses I was allowed to take.  I got to discuss their experiences from going to schools in the city.  Some of them were no where near as fortunate as I was.  Their experiences help me realize exactly the kind of environment I would be entering for my observations and student teaching.  They also shared stories about their communities, the same cultures that my students may be coming from, to help me understand the students better.

                <p>
                  The same artifact about "Holler if you Hear Me" can be used to demonstrate the second proficiency which states that ‚ÄúThe candidate is aware and addresses local, national, and global events, and promotes agency for social justice and equity.‚Äù  The proficiency encourages educators to make students think critically about material, ask how the information is relevant to them, and question the perspective the information is presented from.  Does the perspective of the author align with the majority of public opinion?  What are the thoughts of the people who do not agree, and why do they think the way they do?  These are all important questions that have to be posed to students and that they have to keep in mind whenever they read text, watch television, or interact with any kind of media.  Students constantly interact with media outlets that are sending them messages and shaping their thoughts so they have to be aware of these messages.  If they do not agree with them, then they need the knowledge of how to create an educated differing opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every student has a preference for how they like to learn; usually this preference is the way they learn best.  Some can read from a text book and understand the information while others need charts, graphs, and demonstrations to really understand what is happening.  To encourage learning for all individuals an educator has to use many activities and teaching styles to get all students involved and make them feel involved in the classroom.  I plan to incorporate the traditional lecture and discussion format for many of my classes; however, I also plan to assign projects, labs, and some discovery learning days to help all students enjoy being in my classroom.  For example, to help the students that learn visually, I plan to use online videos, WebQuests, and interactive, online, dissections.  Artifact two is a lesson prepared using multiple strategies to incorporate as many learning styles as possible.  Every lesson cannot include an activity that uses the strength of each individual, however, a variety of activities should be used daily; I should change each day to use as many different types of activities as possible and keep all students involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also important to use many sources of text besides the text book.  Some students will not have the skills necessary to comprehend the language of the text book assigned to their grade level while others will find the text book too easy.  Either type of student will become disengaged with the text book quickly, requiring an educator to find other texts that teach the same material but at a level that is appropriate to the student‚Äôs abilities.  These texts do not have to be text books, but can be articles or trade books that discuss the same topic being covered in class.  Artifact three is a unit plan designed to incorporate many reading and comprehension strategies along with alternative texts for the unit.  As the students build confidence in their reading skills, they participate more.  If I want them to continue contributing to the learning experience I have to create a safe environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step in developing a respectful learning community is clearly stating classroom procedures and ensuring the students understand, and agree to, each procedure.  They must also understand the consequences that would occur if they do not follow the procedures.  This process will go more smoothly if the students are involved in deciding what procedures should be in place in the classroom.  If the students are involved in creating classroom procedures, then they are more likely to follow the procedures without argument because they feel a sense of responsibility to uphold the standards they set for themselves.  This respect for the classroom will translate to respect for each other because they worked together to create a fair environment.  Having them taking part in the process will also make them think about another‚Äôs right to learn in a safe and fair environment.  The respect for a classroom environment and community also applies to the communities they live in and the procedures society expects to follow.  When the students respect the communities they live in, the community will be more willing to help them when they need it, for example, if students are attempting to raise funds for prom or a community service project, the members of the community are more willing to help if the students show respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fifth proficiency states that ‚ÄúThe candidate effectively utilizes concepts, issues, events, and themes from the perspective of diverse ethnic and cultural groups for continual improvement to make schools or clinical settings responsive to the needs of diverse students.‚Äù  As I said earlier, different cultures prioritize different issues and characteristics.  An issue that arises in a community that may not be important on a societal scale may be extremely important to a community.  An educator has to be involved in the community they work in and be aware of the events that are important to the community.  Whether an event matters locally or globally, it is going to affect the student‚Äôs emotions and their ability to learn.  Being aware of all the major issues and events in the community will help a teacher prepare for the consequences of the event.  That may mean that an educator has to postpone their plans to allow students time to cope, mourn, or whatever else may be necessary.  Events that happen in the communities can also be use as teachable moments and help connect the material being taught to the student‚Äôs lives, making the learning more memorable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am currently making progress in the final proficiency that discusses improving my teaching strategies.  I have already obtained an undergraduate degree in my content area, giving me more exposure to biological concepts.  Taking courses at Northeastern Illinois University has allowed me to expand my knowledge of individual differences among my students and how best to accommodate each student.   The course Literacy in Content has armed me with many activities that will help students comprehend reading material.  I will help myself assess and adjust the effectiveness of my lessons using a daily journal.  It will assist me in learning about my students, their behavior patterns, and the responses to the activities I will use.  By reflecting about my teaching I can make changes to be better prepared to help all of my students and fulfill their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students all have different ways of learning and understanding.  An educator has to be able to identify the differences and adapt a classroom to these differences.  If a teacher can be successful at finding the unique characteristics in each individual, then they can help each student learn better and comprehend more.

                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 1: Teaching Diverse Learners</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am very confident in my ability to modify my lessons to create a favorable learning environment for all students.  I have studied how every student has their own way of learning, strengths, and weaknesses.  I know theories about variation among students and have observed many variations.  I have been able to practice my skills during my student teaching where I taught a range of students from those with disabilities and needed and aide to gifted students.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  A focus of EDFN 305, 306, and 307 was all the possible differences between two students.  They can vary in their maturity level, their physical development, social skills, cultures, and so much more.  Learning about each student as an individual is a pivotal part of teaching.  If you do not know much about your students as people it will be impossible for even a few of your students to be successful.  It will be the most taxing and difficult part of being in the classroom.  This will be especially useful when trying to break down emotional barriers that hinder learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have many artifacts that can demonstrate my competency in this first standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first artifact, Artifact 1, is a timeline I created where I describe some of my childhood and adolescent experiences.  They will serve me as reminders of how to treat my students as individual people and respect all their differences.  Specifically, points a, c, d, and f will be the most influential when considering the variety of my students.  In the analysis I discuss how I discovered what way I learn best.  I also talk about my first experiences with coaching and how I learned to vary my explanations and drills to each child I coached so that they could understand better.  Through this kind of reflection I am also able to detect my own biases based on my personal experiences.  For example, I have discovered, through my student teaching, that I favor the athletic students and expect more from them since I know they have to have good grades in order to compete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 2 is a paper containing my observations and analyses of classrooms for EDFN 306.  The purpose of the paper was to observe individual differences between the students.  Observations 2, 3, and 4 best demonstrate my proficiency with this standard.  These artifacts show that I can recognize differences in students and can adjust my teaching to help each student achieve.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  A third artifact is my unit plan, artifact 13, on the cell. Day 4 on page 115 shows I can plan modifications to help ELL students and students with disabilities succeed and not fall behind.  In this lesson I plan to give ELL students a picture with the parts of the microscope labeled so they can understand the vocabulary.  Artifact 14 also demonstrates I can change a lesson to give all students a similar experience with scientific inquiry.  I state that by cutting out the pieces for students with disabilities, they can participate in the inquiry without needing too much extra time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifacts 16 and 17 are based on a specific learning disability; orthopedic disabilities.  These show that I have knowledge on strategies to use to help students with disabilities learn and feel included in the classroom activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 2: Content Area and Pedagogical Knowledge</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When considering my knowledge of my content area I am very competent.  I have spent years studying the biological sciences and other related fields of science.  I am quickly becoming competent in pedagogical knowledge as I gain experience in the classroom.  I know how to vary activities in my lessons to help all students learn in a way they like best.  During my time in a classroom I have learned to question the material for appropriateness for my students.  Many times I have to make adjustments to how I present the information for each class depending on the needs of the students.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 3 is a unit plan I prepared about Genetics.  It is a 10 day unit plan with one interdisciplinary lesson that was prepared in conjunction with a classmate who would like to teach History.  I also prepared 5 detailed lesson plans including Power Point presentations, worksheets, and homework.  Each plan has various kinds of activities, assessment, and methods I would plan to use in my classroom.  Modifications for special students were also included.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also created a content based unit plan, with classmates, that demonstrates how my pedagogical knowledge in incorporating literacy into my content area.  You will see in this artifact that I use different methods in each lesson so all students learn.  The unit plan is in three installments in Artifact 4.  It also represents my content area knowledge.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 13 is a unit plan that includes 2 lessons with math integrated, days 3 and 4.  Each lesson I tried to incorporate a different activity to encourage interest in all students.  At the end of the unit I have a day of ‚Äúpractical application.‚Äù It would be a period-long, whole class, discussion about stem cells.  It a controversial topic and one that has been in the spotlight for most of their lives.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 9 includes a demonstration I used to get students interested in a new topic.  The  demonstration was also meant to be a visual description of how enzymes work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 3: Planning for Differentiated Instruction</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I feel that I am quickly becoming competent as a beginning teacher in planning for differentiated instruction.  I have had some experience planning what I could do when I encounter inclusion students in my classroom.  I have also planned for hypothetical students. I believe my skills have improved greatly during my Clinical Observations and Student Teaching experiences.  Having specific students, with specific needs, has been extremely useful in allowing me to develop this skill.  I have to think for each lesson how I will modify the work so all the students can participate.  I have mostly worked with learning disabled students.  They require me to work time into the day to read them instructions, write the directions as I say them, or create a different graphic organizer for them.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Genetics unit plan in Artifact 3 somewhat demonstrates how I will differentiate instruction for some students.  The modifications section at the end of each specific lesson plan tells how I plan to help the students with each lesson.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 4 also helps demonstrate what competence I have with this standard.  We found various kinds of texts at different reading levels so that all students would be able to read about the topic we are discussing.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 8 shows that I can analyze my surroundings and design lessons based on what I have available to use.  Artifact 9 includes a demonstration that shows I can be creative and make things to use in the classroom to help the students learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 4: Learning Environment</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a high school, one has to exercise extreme caution in the kind of learning environment you create for each individual class.  Some students are better prepared to handle responsibility and independence while others need constant guidance and supervision.  These extremes can even occur in the same classroom.  The type of discipline used and the reward system used will be crucial in encouraging animosity or respect from the students.  I am confident that I will be able to create an environment where the students feel safe, comfortable, and that is conductive to learning.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 5 demonstrates my understanding of how to create a favorable classroom environment. Task A in observation 1, task B in observation 2, and observation 3 are the best examples.  In observation 1 I discuss how a pleasing classroom can be set up with posters, natural light, and student work on display.  This encourages students and helps them relax.  Task B shows I am aware of prejudice in the classroom and the impact it can have on student learning.  By being aware I can prevent myself from working with some students more than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the unit plans, artifacts 3 and 4, I have included many different activities: labs, worksheets, readings, and demonstrations to encourage the students to be active learners.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 13 includes a lesson where students are asked to create posters in groups and teach the rest of their peers about the topic.  This puts the responsibility on the students to do their best to help their classmates.  The project will encourage students to learn as much as possible about their topic and motivate their group members to do the same. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 5: Instructional Delivery</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instructing using the same methods every day becomes monotonous, disengaging, and ineffective.  Students will become impatient if a teach only talks at them and never engages them in learning.  I am very confident in my abilities to vary my instructional delivery.  Lecturing is important but so is guided discovery learning and students following their own inquiries.  Students should not be expected to sit quietly and listen while the teacher tells them what they need to know; the teacher should not be expected to talk all day every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students also should not be expected to sit silently all say, especially at the high school level.  By creating group and pair projects and activities, students have the opportunity to talk to peers while learning content.  However, there is a balance that has to be maintained because the students will quickly get of task if not checked continuously.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Transitioning from one activity to the next can also be cause for distraction of some students.  Establishing a que for the students to know when and practicing how to transition will cut down on transition time and allow me to spend as much time as possible delivering content.  For example, if you tell the students that you will have a certain amount of time to complete an activity and set a timer.  Another option is to play music during the last minute they have to work on an activity so the students know to wrap up their project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 3 shows how I plan to us many types of instructional delivery.  In the outline I list using power points, guided discovery learning, and debate to teach students about the topics of the unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 6 is a strategy lesson I prepared to teach students how to visualize a reading.  It is a script of what I would say to my students to teach them how to take a mental picture and put it on paper.  I use a think aloud strategy to tell my students what I was thinking at each stage of the lesson.  I transition from the focus being on me to the students as they begin to work and ask questions.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  In artifact 13 I use power points, group presentations, class discussion, and scientific inquiry to present new material to the students.  On day 4 the students learn how to use a microscope; an essential skill to a scientist.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 6: Reading, Writing, and Oral Communication</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am extremely confident that I will be able to use all methods of communication in my classroom.  The students will remember the verbal and written communication as long as it is relevant, usually until a test.  Nonverbal and visual communication such as body language or demonstrations will stay with them much longer, especially if they are involved.  There are a variety of methods I can use to ensure the students are also able to communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Preaching them vocabulary by using texts and graphic organizers can help the students to learn vocabulary.  I have asked higher level students to determine the meaning of words from context clues and write those definitions in a graphic organizer then give an example so ensure they understand and to allow them to internalize the meaning of the words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Power Points in Artifact 3 show how I utilize pictures to explain concepts to my students.  I also discuss using a demonstration at the beginning of Day 4 of my unit plan  where I have the students manipulate M&Ms to show how traits are passed and introduce the Laws of Genetics.  I also pose questions throughout the lessons to emphasize important points and gain insight into how well the students are understanding the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The strategy lesson in Artifact 6 gives an example of my verbal communication; how I would explain how to physically represent a mental image. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 12 includes a class brainstorm to encourage safety when handling microscopes and proper behavior in the classroom while the microscopes are out.  This encourages student involvement and collaboration among the students.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 7: Assessment</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Constantly assessing the students‚Äô comprehension of the material you are teaching them is extremely important.  Using diagnostic, formative, and summative assessments is crucial.  Diagnostic assessments will help me to anticipate what the students will have issues with, what we will have to spend extra time discussing, and what they already know, information we do not have to spend as much time as planned discussing.  Formative assessments can come in many forms.  I have used posters the students create to determine if they understood the material.  Quizzes and test for summative assessments has helped me to review my methods and determine what lessons were effective and which were not.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Artifact 3 I have many different methods of diagnostic and formative assessment, such as, comments the students may make that show they understand or responses to writing prompts they will submit.  I also use worksheets, homework, labs, and an exam as summative assessments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 4 also has various kinds of assessments throughout the unit.  In installment 2 we planned for an informal assessment of the student‚Äôs background knowledge.  INstallment 3 discusses how we would incorporate technology into out unit and how it will be used to assess the students‚Äô comprehension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifacts 10 and 11 were a lesson and a study I conducted about the effectiveness of a lesson about how to construct a bibliography.  I used questioning during the lesson to determine what prior knowledge the students had and surveys, before and after, to determine if they really learned what they needed to that day.    
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Standard 8: Collaborative Relationships</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I do not plan to try to keep my classroom isolated and keep what occurs in my classroom a secret.  I want to try to incorporate as much of the students‚Äô backgrounds in my instruction as possible.  This includes incorporating their interests and the community.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having the community involved in the classroom is important for the students because if the students see that their community supports them, then they will be more motivated to succeed.n the community is not the only group that I would like to involve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having the parents involved is also critical.  If the parents do not value education, then the student will not value education and may not expect much from themselves.  In these cases I have to find a way to motivate the students and make them realize that education is important and even though they may have to do a lot of work to catch up, they are capable.  This has to come from my classroom and other's.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am very confident in my abilities to cooperate with another educator in a different subject.  As long as both parties are willing to communicate and compromise, I believe that very interesting and engaging instruction can result.  By making these kinds of interdisciplinary lessons, the students are involved with the same content for a longer amount of time.  The more exposure and practice the students have with the content the better they will internalize the information. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Artifact 3, Day 9, is an interdisciplinary lesson I created in tandem with a classmate that will be teaching history.  We decided to focus our lesson Social Darwinism and its historical and biological implications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artifact 4 was created with two classmates.  It shows I am capable of working with colleagues in a constructive way.

                  Days 3 and 4 in artifact 13 show I would like to incorporate math into those lessons.  By working with another subject the students can draw similarities between the two.  They also are able to apply what is learned in one class to another.

                  Teachers have to be a role model for their students as well as presenting them with information that is relevant to the content area.  This means acting in a professional manner, asking colleagues for help when needed, and communicating with parents as necessary.  A teacher also has to communicate with their students outside the classroom and act as a mediator when problems arise.  They have to be judge and jury in their classroom to ensure the safety and well-being of all students.  We need to be very aware of our students and try to intervene in problems when we suspect something.  Sometimes the students have no options available to them, it is part of our job to protect them when they do not know what else they can do.  By always being aware of the students a perceptive teacher can change a lot of things and circumvent many problems.  Finally, a teacher is responsible for reflecting on themselves and improving what they can improve.  Continuing education to keep methods and technology up to date will be essential in this improvement.

                  Artifact 5 discusses methods and teaching styles I observed at a Chicago Public School.  I talk about what each teacher did and why they would be a good role model or a teacher that I want to avoid mimicking.  I also criticized a few behaviors the teacher did and why it could be detrimental to the students or the classroom environment.

Artifact 15 is a reflection and presentation on the tapped lesson.  These show that I can reflect on my teaching.  I can determine what needs to be improved, what worked well, and what I should not do again.

                  My first memorable friendship, that was not with my twin, was with a group of identical triplets.  We all met in Little Mrs. Muffet‚Äôs pre-school and bonded over the fact that no one could tell us from our sister.  At the time, I thought it was amazing to find other people that looked exactly like their sisters.  We always all played together in a group, so if one girl was sick it did not matter because there were others to  play with.  I remember some people only had one other person to socialize with and if they were not there that day the other person would sometimes play with other people and sometimes they would end up playing by themselves.  Thinking back it was nice to always have someone else around whether it was just my sister or the triplets.   I always feel bad I cannot remember their names, but I think we bonded because we did not know how to interact with people besides our sisters.  Being with other multiples allowed us to interact with other people without leaving our comfort zones.  I will always remember to treat students as individuals and not group or stereotype them.  If each person is treated as their own person then they may feel more confident and like they do not blend in.

                 My first memory of television is from when I was three years old in 1993.  My family went down the street to watch Jurassic Park on VHS on the neighbor‚Äôs new big screen TV with surround sound.  The only part I remember is the scene where the T-rex attacks the Jeeps and there is a close-up of the dinosaur roaring; I got scared and jumped over the back of the couch and hid.  Everyone had to tell me it was not real and that the dinosaur was not going to be eaten by a dinosaur.  Whenever I watch Jurassic Park now I laugh at myself a little bit at that scene.  I learned the difference between reality and fantasy and it was my first introduction to what technology can accomplish.  It also taught me that not everything on TV is real and that sometimes people have to be shown and taught to see what is real and what is fake.  Students need to think about the information they are given and decide what their opinions are about the information.

                 Being an identical twin, it was always difficult to feel unique because everyone always clumped us together and treated us the same because they thought that we were the same person.  It was not until I was eight years old and started playing softball, which my twin did not want to play, that I felt unique.  At first my team did not know I had a twin unless I told them and none of them met her.  I was excited that I had something to do away from my sister and I had a lot of fun playing softball.  The only reason I started playing softball was because I wanted to have an experience that was different than my twin‚Äôs and it was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself.  I was allowed to be an individual and I have to always remember to not put my students into a box.

                 I realized I was an adolescent on vacation one summer with my family.  We were having lunch at a park and I reached across my brother to get something, and he said ‚Äúyou need to shave your armpit.‚Äù  I was about twelve and he was ten;  I was extremely embarrassed and would not lift my arms the rest of the trip.  At the time I did not think that I was an ‚Äúadolescent,‚Äù I just thought that I was becoming a teenager.  After that I became more conscious about my body; not about my body shape because I was extremely fit.  I had been doing gymnastics for most of my life and had started working out 20 hours a week at about 9 years old, so the last worry on my mind was my body.  I was more concerned about pimples and the hair growing that comes with puberty.  As as teacher I have to always be aware of the consequences of my comments because someone may take something the wrong way and be offended.

                 The first time I realized my intelligence was in second grade after one of the many standardized tests.  There was a question that asked ‚ÄúWho were the first people in America?‚Äù  The choices were the Indians, the Pilgrims, the Colonists, and one other choice I can not remember.  I choose the Pilgrims were the first ones in America because they arrived first, however, the correct answer was the Indians because they were already here when the Pilgrims arrived.  Initially I was mad because it felt like I was tricked and the question was unfair.  Now that I think about it, it was the first time that I had to think about a question and consider the different ways to look at it.  I thought the question was asking who arrived first, as in who came from another place first, not who was physically on the land first.  After that I began to look at problems I did not know the answer to from any possible angle.  Students have to be encouraged to view things from different points of view, and sometimes a point of view they are not comfortable with.

                <p>
                 The first time I ever though about how my thinking works was not until my Psychology 100 class my freshman year of college.  I realized that my view of the world was naive sometimes and I did not consider many other points of view.  Now I am grateful for that class discussion because it reminded me that if I ask other people their opinion they can introduce new ways for me to think.  During that class I met people that came from very different places than myself and some had a much more morbid and distrustful views on society and life.  I realized that the world is not as wonderful as I was made to believe and that hardship is not always overcome by hard work.  This experience made me realize that when I am teaching it is important for me to be the devils advocate and provoke discussion and debate among my students so that they understand where other people come from and how it shapes their views and opinions.

                 The first time I realized that I had a my own personality was the first time someone said to me ‚Äúyou and your sister are nothing alike.‚Äù  I was extremely excited and I had to know why they thought we were complete opposites.  One reason I was happy I was the opposite of Aimee was because I though she was a brat at the time and I could tell she had a hard time making friends and getting along with other people.  I can see now how different my twin and I are; after many conversations with my dad he had pointed out all the differences, but I can also see all the similarities.  Once I heard other people thought we had different personalities I began to relax, embrace my own personality, and stopped trying to be a twin.  Each student I will have will have their own personality and I should not force them to change their behavior if it is not an issue.

                 My favorite teacher was my Chemistry teacher from my sophomore year of high school.  I loved the class because Ms. Sloan was encouraging  and wanted us to increase our interest in the sciences by exploring what science really was.  She was also the first person to ask for our won thoughts and opinions.  I always appreciate what she did for us in that class; she made me love science and want to know more.  The class was not memorization and just learning what we had to learn to pass a test.  She wanted us to discover things for ourselves and learn my mistake.  There was one class period where she brought a bottle of liquid nitrogen and froze marshmallows and let us eat them.  I want to be a teacher like her, I want to encourage students to discover new things and enjoy learning.  I want students to always remember the class they take with me, even if they hate the class at the time I want them to be able to look back and think it was worth taking.

                 My very first good experience was when I was in kindergarden.  We were all given number scrolls to fill out over the course of the year.  When I reached 400 on my scroll i showed my teacher and I was given some candy.  I was extremely proud of my self because I worked very hard on my numbers and was rewarded for it.  I still have my scroll hidden in a box in the attic at my parent‚Äôs house.  My scroll always gives me a good feeling because it was the first project that I put a lot of effort into and was rewarded for my hard work.  That was my first lesson that hard work pays off, and it was always reinforced throughout my schooling career.  If I want students to work hard I have to reward them.   I think that just giving them good grades is not enough; I have to give them praise or another reward.

                 My first bad, and probably worst, school experience happened in kindergarden.  My class was putting together a skit based on the book of poems called ‚ÄúChicken Soup with Rice.‚Äù  The book was had all the months and each month had it‚Äôs own short poem.  My poem was March, and during the skit I had to knock a bowl of confetti on the floor and afterwards I had to pick up every piece of confetti.  One of my friends tried to help me clean it up and the teacher told her she could not help me and no one else was allowed to either.  I felt like I was being punished for something that I was told to do.   Still today I am still confused and do not understand why my teacher would not let my friends help me.  It always bothers me when people are hypocritical; and I always point it out to them.  I am always careful to do what I say I will do, and act how I want other people to act otherwise how can people believe what I say.

                 I realized I was an adult one weekend when I was visiting home from school and my dad picked my up from the train station and we were talking about my plans for the night.  I was going to go spend the night with my friends and I asked what time I should be home.  He told me to be home at whatever time I wanted to be home.  He told that I was an adult and he could not tell me what to do anymore, that he could only give me advice and I could choose to follow it or not.  I knew that it was hard for my dad to tell me that I could make all the decisions in my life.  After that night I always think about what is the least inconvenient for my parents.  I started thinking more about the consequences of my actions on other people than for myself.  Since I would like to teach high school I have to remember to treat all my students like adults and let them choose what to do and accept the consequences.

                  I started coaching tumbling when I was 15 years old at Cheer Fusion.  My students ranged in age from 4 to 16 years old, both boys and girls.  I decided that I wanted to teach when one of my girls finally got a skill and immediately wanted to show her mom and kept doing the trick over and over.  It reminded me of when I was learning new gymnastics skills and getting extremely excited every time I learned something new.  I started getting the same feeling in high school calculus when something would click and I would have a ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment with sudden understanding of how a theory works.  I want to be able to help my students achieve those moments and love the feeling.  I also want them to want to continue learning outside of what is taught in the classroom by discovering on their own.  I want to give them the basics they need to get where they want to in life, to encourage curiosity.  I will always watch for that moment of understanding from my students and if someone is not getting it I want to encourage them to ask questions to gain a clearer understanding.

                 The last few months have been the happiest of my life.  In May I finished my degree in Biology from University at Illinois at Chicago.  I also qualified in pole vault for the DI NCAA Track and Field West Regional meet in Texas where I placed 30th in the Region and ended in the top 50 in the Nation.  I also won my conference in pole vault, seeing as it was my last year I was very excited.  In June I moved away from my sister and into a condo with my boyfriend of about 6 years.  A week later he proposed, and immediately told me that he does not get want to have the wedding until I have finished my student teaching so that I would have less stress when the wedding comes.  I am so extremely grateful that I have someone to support me and understand everything that I am going through.  I want to always be empathetic to my students; let them know that if they need help or someone to talk their problems out with I will do the best that I can to help them.

                  I was fortunate to have gone through a very good school system in the suburbs of Chicago where all the teachers were paid well and enjoyed teaching.  We always had the latest equipment and technology.  My schools were well organized and funded and I got the education that every parent wants their child to have; I was thoroughly prepared for college and all its challenges.  I have a lot of unique experiences being that most people do not have an identical twin to go through life with like I did.
                  Growing up I was always compared to not only my twin, but my older sister and younger brother.  My parents compared all of our grades even though we were all in different grades, classes, and had all different teachers.  It was the worst when we received out standardized test scores.  My mom would sit at the kitchen table and say things like ‚ÄúAimee did better than you in reading, why didn‚Äôt you do as well? But you did better in math.‚Äù  That constant comparison and competition drove me to do the absolute best that I could in every aspect of my life.  I was fortunate that I was academically and athletically gifted.

                  My talent in some sports allowed me to enjoy a lot of different sports.  I was not good at softball, but because I was fast there were some things I was good at such as stealing bases and playing the outfield.  Without my athletic abilities I would not have had many of the experiences I had.  Most of my best memories and learning experiences were while I was doing some sport.  I learned discipline from gymnastics, persistence from pole vaulting, and to have fun from softball.  It also helped that no matter how bad or good I was at something, my parents were always supportive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My family gave me the opportunities to do everything I wanted.  My parents never missed a softball game, gymnastics meet, or track meet.  They listened to me complain and they listened to all the good stories.  They taught me to be compassionate and that listening to what people have to say, even if they are just venting, helps.

                  Understanding developmental factors is extremely important when wanting to teach secondary education because that is when students are going through massive changes in their lives, both physically and psychologically.  To combat the morning drowsiness that students experience as the go through adolescence I would get my students up and moving around first thing in the morning; swinging their arms, getting their heart rates up a little bit.  Yes, it does take a couple minutes first thing in the morning, but I think the students would be more alert and they will absorb the information better if they are not groggy.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  I also understand that life can be stressful; with concerns about their bodies and social lives, going to school feels more like a job.  In order to make them relax and maybe have some fun with their classmates I could have my students review for a test by playing a game such as Jeopardy.  This could help the students connect with their peers and socialize with, and be accepted by, people they may not usually talk to.

                <p> 
                  In high school students‚Äô brains are extremely developed and they can understand abstract concepts.  They do not just need a work sheet with fill-in-the-blanks for homework.  I think they need discussion to voice what they think is possible with the information given to them in the class.  Students need to be able to explore the possibilities in the world and see what they think and why they think that.  I want to introduce controversial topics and see what they think the future holds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned at a young age that I have very good body awareness and that I am a physical learner.  In gymnastics, once I learned a skill and practiced it for a while I could tell what I was doing wrong without anyone watching and telling me.  Later I took that knowledge and learned that I remember information better when I write it down.  It is sometimes hard for me to learn without a physical example in front of me that I can look at, dissect, and analyze.  I can learn that way, but it takes much longer and I have to ask a lot of questions so that I can visualize what I am being told.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If someone were trying to teach me something I would tell them to come armed with paper and patience.  For every subject I write down information, for example, I write vocabulary lists for foreign languages with the language I am learning on one side and the translation on the other.  When memorizing information, I will not make notecards, I write note packets so I an writing the information another time and I have an organized book to read and re-read.  I know plenty of people who learn by repetition like I do, but I also know many people who can grasp difficult concepts by just listening.  The best advise for someone teaching me is a simple explanation and paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All my memories will be important to my teaching, however the ones I have of coaching will be the most important.  Coaching was my first experience of passing on information to someone else.  I mainly taught beginner tumbling classes where I would have 5-6 kids.  Sometimes I was lucky enough to have 3 kids all learning the same skill, but usually they were all at different places.  Coaching was how I developed patience, I began to understand that not everyone learns the same way, or at the same speed, and how to organize and teach all the students even though they were not all learning the same skills.  I frequently had to change how I explained a skill, set up the drills, or even what drills to teach.  These memories will help me build a basis because they introduced me to the challenges that come with a classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other memories, such as the ones of my good and bad experiences of school, will help me remember that school is usually boring unless the teacher helps make it fun.  I want to show my students compassion, understanding, and let them come to me if they need to talk about an issue.  Since I would like to teach high school, I want to treat the students as adults and let them make their own decisions.  All the classes that I really enjoyed in high school were the ones where the teachers allowed us to make choices whether we wanted to do the work, participate in discussions, or stay awake during class.  Finally, my memories will always remind me to let my students‚Äô opinions, thought, and beliefs be heard in a non-biased way.  If a student is just regurgitation information they are told to learn without thinking why they should learn it, then the information will be forgotten almost immediately and they will not have really learned anything.

                  I have known for a long time that I wanted to be a teacher, however, I did not decide until high school that I wanted to teach secondary education.  My observation hours were completed in the Lincoln Park neighborhood at Latin School of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois.  It is a private school that houses a lower, middle, and upper school.  The schedule at Latin has far from a normal schedule.  The have a block schedule that is on an eight day rotation, so during my observations the classes I sat in were not always the same even if I attended the school at the same time on two consecutive days.  The students did not seem to have need for anything; they all had designer backpacks, clothes, and many had personal laptops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every class I observed had at least 2 empty chairs.  According to one of the teachers there were about 100 students is each grade in the upper school.  There was an average of 14 students in the classroom.  This year the school had started the process of reversing the order of science classes; instead of freshman taking biology first they are taking physics then chemistry and they will take biology as juniors and seniors.

                  The student I interviewed is a senior in high school in the Northwest suburbs.  I have known her for about 10 years; when we first met she was a little shy, but as we saw each other more often she became more outgoing.

Every wall and cabinet is a dry erase surface and there is a cup of dry erase markers on the teacher‚Äôs desk.  There was an area in the back of the classroom with four lab benches.  The tables are set up in the front half of the room as a U on the outside and two tables are pushed together to make a block in the center of the U.  There are butterfly cages hanging from the ceiling and what looked like an old experiment or demonstration on one of the back counters.  There are many large windows, so the room is filled with natural light.  The room is also equipped with a fume hood and labeled cabinets and drawers with lab equipment.

                  When the students first entered the classroom they picked seats and a couple of students pulled personal laptops out of their pack backs.  One student, S1, immediately began checking her Facebook page and another student, S2, was looking through his email.  The boy and girl then started discussion a paper they had due in a few days for another class and S2 opened a word document and began to work on the assignment.  The teacher, T, had already started class and after a few minutes asked the students to put their computers away because she did not allow computers in her class.

                  During the rest of the period various students began working on other homework and the teacher did not tell them to put the work away.  Only one or two of the students were distracted by me being in the classroom.  Other distraction included chewing on pencils, tipping their chairs, and talking to other classmates.

                  The teacher explained a worksheet the students were to complete in groups with white boards, 2 feet by 3 feet, for each group.  The students began to move around immediately when the teacher explained the worksheet would be done as groups and they all missed important instructions on how to complete the calculations necessary to complete the worksheet.  The teacher was required to explain the calculations to each of the three individual groups.  While in the groups, the students were gossiping with each other and not completing the work assigned.   When the class came back together they were side tracked for about five minutes by a conversation about why distance runners do not listen to music while they run.

                  When I scheduled with Latin School of Chicago to come and observe on Halloween, I expected the students to be a little more excited and less focused.  The class I went to was all seniors and I think they felt too old to dress up for Halloween.  I was very surprised that even though the students had their cell phones, some had them on the table next to their books, they were not texting.  The teacher kept good control over her class when things began to get out of hand, which was not often since the students were very mature.

                <p>
                  During the group activity some of the students still did not understand the calculations after the teacher explained the instructions multiple times.  They did finally understand once their group members explained the instructions again.  I think that the students understood better when their peers explained the instructions because they had a different perspective on the material, having just learned it themselves.  They also had time to use the data they were working with as an example to go through the calculation step-by-step, where the teacher had to help the other two groups.

                  About half of the students in the class were dressed up for Halloween.  When the students entered the room the began talking to friends about parties happening over the coming weekend.  Only a few students sat in their seats and got ready for class.  Some began to throw small pieces of paper at their friends.  When the teacher was ready to begin class, it took the students a couple of minutes to quiet down so they could begin.

                  The first thing to do was hand back some graded quizzes to the students.  The students immediately began to talk, tip their chairs back, and some began to make odd noises.  Next, the class discussed the results of a lab they had previously done.  The teacher asked students to go to the board and draw various graphs.  One boy, MS1, tried to draw attention to himself when he was called to the board by cheering and throwing his hands in the air.  MS1 wrote ‚Äúdrawn by the great‚Äù and his name.  The teacher was also forced to get the attention of MS1 several times because he was staring out the window or trying to talk to his classmates.

                  There were more side conversations while the teacher was answering a question from one student, then another student would ask the same question.  One student turned around in their chair and tried to distract another student while they were asking their question.  The students were also asking questions about Halloween candy and when the teacher was going to hand out the candy he had for them.  At the end of the period, there students were upset by an announcement that they would have a quiz in two days.

                  While observing the freshman, I felt like they did not understand what the expectations were for their behavior.  It could also have been due to the excitement of Halloween, however, the teacher did not ask the students to quiet down when they were loud.  There were even times when I had a hard time hearing exactly what the teacher was saying because of all the extra conversations.  The students‚Äô behavior could have been due to the students transitioning from junior high to high school.  Even though they were in the same building the students were now at the bottom of the high school, in a new part of the building.

                  The male student, MS1, that tried to get the attention of his classmates was demonstrating characteristic of Piaget‚Äôs formal operational stage called adolescent egocentrism (Santrock, 2011, p. 136).  I think that MS1 thought everyone was watching him and he had to perform for his audience; what David Elkind refers to as the ‚Äúimaginary audience‚Äù (Santrock, 2011, p. 136).

                  Before the students entered the class, the teacher told me that there was one student in the class who asked questions that were beyond the scope of the class.  There was one female Asian student, AS1, in the class with a slight accent.  She sat in the chair closest to the white board and where the teacher was standing.  When entering the room AS1 sat down and took out her notebook while the other students talked with classmates or checked their cellphones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first activity was a homework quiz.  AS1 asked multiple questions for clarification on the quiz while other students asked just one question or no questions.  Immediately following the quiz, AS1 began asking for the answers to the questions to the quiz because she wanted to know what she had gotten right and wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, the teacher began giving notes.  Most of the students became distracted at one time or another during note taking, AS1 watched the teacher intently and wrote down everything the teacher wrote on the board and said.  AS1 also frequently asked questions to clarify the information.  While doing examples, the teacher would ask for the answer to the questions AS1 would blurt out the answers first.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final activity of the day was to review a worksheet.  While going over the worksheet AS1 asked ‚Äúhow would you write the answer for this question?‚Äù  AS1 wanted to answer the question exactly as the teacher would write the answer.

                <p>
                  While observing the class, it was more obvious that AS1 had an accent suggesting that she spoke another language.  AS1 got embarrassed when she answered a question incorrectly.  She was also frustrated when the teacher did not seem to understand what she was asking.  It was not that the teacher did not understand what she was asking; the answers to her questions were beyond the comprehension of the class and too complicated to fully explain in the time left in the class.  AS1 was extremely focused on her grades and academic performance; according to Ludger Woessmann (2011) there is a higher expectation of academic performance in Asian cultures than in American culture (p. 2).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with being concerned with her grades, AS1 did not interact with her classmates as the other students did.  During transition time in the class, the other students would talk among themselves but AS1 would just get her things ready for the next part of the class.  She also did not dress the same as the rest of the girls in the class.  This makes me believe that she is socially awkward and possibly isolated from here peers.

                  Upon entering the classroom, some of the students were very loud and talkative and others said nothing.  Several times during the class the students debated with the teacher about various topics.  During these discussions the students there were more outgoing just said what they wanted to saw where the students who were shy raised their hands when they wanted to speak.  There was one female student, FS1, that was very distracted by me being in the classroom; she frequently looked back to where I was sitting.  FS1 also was one of the loudest students and kept interrupting the teacher.  Contrasting her was another female student of Indian descent, IS1.  IS1 was shy and only raised her hand a few times during class to ask questions or make a comment.

                  The outgoing students took longer to get focused when switching from one task to another, they shouted more when they were excited about the topic being discussed, and took the class discussions off topic.  Toward the end of the class FS1 tried to involve me in the conversation because she felt bad that I was sitting alone and not participating.  She became somewhat emotional and was nearly in tears after the teacher explained that I was there only to watch.

                  Considering it was a Wednesday, the students were in a very good mood.  Most of the students in the class were extroverted; they were loud, uninhibited, and excited.  With the class being almost all females I expected the class to be loud and there to be many side conversations.  The introverts were much more reserved, polite, and seemed more respective of the teacher because they raised their hands.  The introverted students also stayed on topic and transitioned from one activity to another more easily.

                  It appeared that the teacher had a hard time controlling the class at times because of the noise level in the classroom.  Also, the teacher seemed liked he was more of a friend to the students than a teacher because he did not try very hard to keep the class on topic.  The behavior of the class was dependent on both the students‚Äô temperament and the teacher‚Äôs allowance of these behaviors.

                  The teacher was excited when he began teaching; he encouraged excitement in his students.  To introduce the topic of relativity the teacher found an old video done by college professors.  The video showed demonstrations of relatively and asked the viewers to think about what they were seeing.  In one video the professor was sitting on a platform with a lattice wall behind him, when one began to move he asked the viewer which they thought was moving: him on the platform or the wall behind him? The kids were excited about the movie; one student even commented ‚Äúwow.‚Äù

                  After the video the teacher began on the topic of force and brought out an air disc that would glide across a surface when any force was applied.  During the lecture and demonstration the teacher asked the students for answers.  The students participated more when they were called on for the answer randomly.  When the students answered the question correctly the teacher was excited for them.

                  The demonstration with the air disc had the attention of all the students.  They were entranced by the way the disc moved and quickly understood Newton‚Äôs first law of motion that states an external force has to be applied to an object to change its state of motion (Walker, 2010, p. 113).  It seems like a straight forward idea but when applying the law it can be complicated.  The teacher kept repeating the idea and showing the students what it meant until all the students began to understand the idea, then he began asking questions.  When the teacher started calling on the students for answers to his questions I expected them to freeze and mumble the answers.  The teacher was encouraging if they knew the correct answer or not.  Getting the students excited was important to the teacher‚Äôs style.  The more energy the students and teacher had the more the students focused and participated.  The video for relativity was important and an excellent way to introduce a complex, and abstract, topic.  The teacher was focused on his students the whole class.  He looked for understanding in his students and was not worried about the amount of information they covered during the class.

                  The science department at Latin School of Chicago began a process this year that would help their students better understand the sciences. The science department started freshmen on a new science track that was different from previous years because they would begin in physics instead of biology.  Switching the order of progression would relate the science class to the math level the students could understand.  As freshman, the students are enrolled in, or have taken, algebra that they can then apply to physics.  Calculus is much easier to use in physics, however, most high school students will not take a calculus class until college.  It is a much better option than waiting to teach physics until junior year when the students are taking advanced algebra with trigonometry or pre-calculus and have forgotten basic algebra.  The students begin to use the information they are learning and incorporate it into information they have learned in the past.  The students were building schemas and were able to come to the next class and relate the old information to the new material.  They fit into Piaget‚Äôs formal operational stage where they are expected to form hypotheses about what is going to happen based on past knowledge (Santrock, 2011, p. 57).

                  The students take part in labs two days a week, allowing them to apply what they have been taught during lecture and discovering how the theories apply to real situations.  It is similar to allowing children to play and discover what the world is about; the main difference was that the students in the lab are directed towards a certain discovery.

                  In some of the classes the students spent time practicing on a worksheet with the teacher and were allowed to ask questions as needed.  The repetition helped the students to remember the formula they were required to know and as they became closer to completing the worksheet they became faster at the calculations.

                <p>
                  Each student will have their own habits formed when they enter high school.  A teacher has to help their students think about the information they are learning and why it is important.  The teacher can repeat themselves and ask the students to memorize facts to write on the test, but the students may not remember the information later.  Students need to build knowledge through understanding not memorization.

                  <i>How do students‚Äô physical, social, emotional, ethical, and cognitive development influence learning?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When students enter high school some may be well into puberty, some just starting, and some still waiting to start puberty.  According to Santrock (2011), adolescents who begin puberty earlier have higher self esteem and those who start late have a lower self esteem (p. 88).  This self esteem level will help determine whether the student develops problems; behavioral or mental.  Santrock (2011) also states that the actions the student takes can change their brain development (p.89).  These changes can affect their cognitive development and their ability to construct knowledge into useful schemas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a student is not as socially developed as their peers, they may be avoided and have a difficult time making friends since others will see them as immature.  These students may also have issues working in groups because they may not know how to communicate their ideas to their group members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The student that is emotionally immature may not have a hard time finding friends, but they may have other behavioral problems that cause them to be disruptive.  This kind of student may have outbursts in class, disrupting everyone, or become completely unfocused if they do not understand the material causing them to fall farther behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A teacher is responsible to their students to identify if any student is severely behind in the development of their physical, social, emotional, ethical, or cognitive abilities.  They have to help the student in what ways they can before asking for additional help.  A teacher has to be aware that if a student is acting inappropriately, or performing poorly, that there are underlying causes.  If the cause is that the student does not understand the material, then the teacher must set aside some time to help that student and keep them from falling farther behind.

                  <i>What are some of the different approaches to learning and performance that you have seen? What do you recommend to deal with different learning styles, multiple intelligences, and performance modes?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the classrooms used the same approaches to teaching.  The most common aspects were lecturing, worksheets, and review of past assignments.  The order varied by teacher.   During lectures the students were expected to be taking notes and asking questions immediately if they did not understand an idea.  The teachers always had a visual, whether it was a power point presentation with the notes on the slides, or writing the notes on the white board for the students to copy down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The worksheets included verbal explanations of the instructions, what was expected while working on the assignment, and how long they would have to complete the activity.  The teachers were available for questions or if a student needed further clarification.  In one of the chemistry classes, the majority of the students were struggling with one particular problem so the teacher pulled the class back together to solve the problem as a whole.  He asked simple questions that related the past material to the worksheet so the students could understand the connection and how the information built on itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Usually the worksheets were to be done individually, however, the teachers encouraged the students to work with classmates on problems they did not understand.  They wanted the students to do what they could and not have one person do all the work while the others copy.  During the AP Environment class the students each had a set of data they were responsible for in their group.  The group would then discuss why the calculations were correct or if there was a mistake before comparing their answers with the other groups in the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When questions were taken on the homework, every teacher took the most common question the students had issues with and explained the problem.  Usually, by the time homework was being reviewed time was short.  If a student had other problems they wished to discuss the student and teacher planned a time to meet to finish clarifying any issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One feature of teaching was common among all the teachers; they were all accessible to their students and approachable.  The students did not seemed intimidated to go ask for more help, and were not ashamed if they had a question.  Not everyone learns the same way and these teachers were aware.  Their explanations of a theory were never worded the same way twice.  They also included a range of activities: worksheets, lectures, readings, group projects, independent study, labs, and videos to make the subjects relate to all the students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Howard Gardner stated that there are eight frames of mind: verbal skills, mathematical skills, spatial skills, bodily-kinesthetic skills, musical skills, interpersonal skills, intrapersonal skills, and naturalist skills (Santrock, 2011, p. 188).  A student can excel in one or many of these frames of mind.  A teacher needs to identify how each student learns best and how the class learns together.  They then need to base their activities to fit the students learning needs.  The sciences are closely related to math but if the class is full of students that are bad with numbers, then worksheets filled with numbers may help the students build their mathematical skills.

                  <i>How do human development, learning theory, neural science, and the ranges of individual variation within each domain interact?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a human develops and grows myelination occurs in the brain, allowing for information processing to happen faster (Santrock, 2011, p. 93).  This is important in physical development because as a human grows they need to develop greater muscle control and motor skills.  The neurons have to be able to send sensory information to the brain quickly if the student is to learn.  The faster the brain can process information, the more complex and abstract ideas the student can understand and build into their learning schemas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a student goes through school they should be able to understand more complicated subjects like Calculus and Chemistry.  If a student has a defect in the myelination process they will likely be cognitively underdeveloped for their age since information processing does not occur as quickly.  In adolescents, it is important that the corpus callosum develops because it assists with information processing (Santrock, 2011, p. 95).  Other parts of the brain have to develop as a student ages such as the amygdala, which controls emotions, so the student can develop skills to control their emotions and display behaviors that are socially acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Teachers have to be patient when dealing with students that may be late developing.  They may need extra time on assignments and extra help when it can be offered.  Alternative assignments can also be used to help these students understand better if methods like lecturing and worksheets are not sufficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the student is having behavioral problems it has to be explained to them why the behavior is inappropriate and they need help realizing an appropriate way to display their emotions.  Performing behaviors that are expected of them will help the brain develop and the student can begin to catch up with their classmates.
                </p>

                  <i>How do cultural and gender differences affect communication in the classroom?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Respecting cultural differences is extremely important when dealing with students.  Behaviors that are expected in one culture may not be as heavily emphasized in another.  Words, phrases, and even gestures may have a different meaning to someone from a different culture.  For example, what an American would call a ‚Äúpeace‚Äù sign means ‚Äúup yours‚Äù in Australia. According to Ellen Johnson (1997), differences in cultural norms may cause communication issues, for example, some students may feel shame if they are wrong in public, so unless they know the answer, they will not answer a question when called (p. 48).  The lack of an answer may cause the teacher to believe that they do not understand.  Many cultures teach their students it is better to be part of a group than an individual; the student from this kind of culture may avoid showing their intelligence by answering a question because they would put themselves above the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, gender differences do not have as much of an affect on communication in the classroom because we have mostly defeated the idea that men are the breadwinners of the home and women are the caretakers.  Caroline Hunt developed an idea called ‚Äúmunicipal housekeeping‚Äù meaning that they could manage the house by buying goods instead of making them, and take classes to become educated and partake in social reform (Spring, 2011, p. 207).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An issue that may be caused by gender differences is some students not being comfortable in the same class with the opposite sex, making them shy and unwilling to participate (Johnson, 1997, p. 50).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A teacher has to meet their students early and understand their backgrounds so break downs in communication do not get misconstrued as the student not understanding.  It may require the teacher to read about the student‚Äôs culture or meet with the student and their parents to better understand how to make the student the most comfortable in the classroom.  To help students from other cultures get involved a teacher should vary the ways they present information and the activities the students are assigned.

                  <i>What did you learn from doing your observations and conducting this interview?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interview was awkward even though the girl I was meeting with was a friend.  I am not used to being in a formal position.  The interview questions felt stiff when I asked and she was unsure of the answer I wanted.  It seemed as thought she thought there was a right and wrong answer to the questions.  The interview was also strange because I already knew a lot about the girl I talked with so she felt awkward answering basic questions that I knew the answer to; such as the question about the neighborhood she lives in now.  At one point we both felt so strange I suggested that we take a break and just catch-up.  Afterwards, the interview became more like a conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While doing my observations I realized that I am not much older than the seniors I was observing.  Since I look younger than my age, they sometimes mistook me for a student and tried to get me involved in their class.  Only once did someone ask if I was going to be their substitute teacher for that day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got an introduction into what a teacher has to do to make a class work; how to get the students to calm down and focus.  I learned that when explaining a complex theory, you may have to repeat yourself five or six more times, but the explanation has to be worded differently.  If you are lucky all your students will begin to understand what you are saying.  If not, then you have to find another way to present the theory.  I learned that the teachers at the school still enjoy their job, even if they have been teaching for a long time because they kept taking classes and learning about new and innovative ways to teach their students.

                <p>
                  <i>What do you conclude from the interview?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think the girl I interviewed is a typical suburban high school student.  She may have experienced some discrimination when she was younger and it either did not bother her or she has moved on.  Most of the things she likes to do were social activities.  She also met many of her friends at school, promoting the idea that school is meant as a social setting (Dewey, 1897, p 77).  She does not seem like the type of student that will benefit from a teacher that only lectures and assigns reading from a text book because she said she like to have visuals and examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>How will you use this information in your teaching?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned a lot from observing the teachers and students at Latin School of Chicago.  I saw the differences in the way the Freshman and Seniors were treated by the teachers and how the students reacted to being treated as equals instead of students.  The Freshman had rules and a structure they were expected to follow because they could not handle the freedom of the discussion the Seniors had in some of their classes.  In one Senior class they politely debated the topic of the day versus in a freshman class, where whenever the teacher was not talking there were many side conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I saw effective and ineffective ways of getting a class back on track when the students went on tangents.  One teacher became stern and said they had to finish the topic and they could talk about other things later.  Another teacher allowed the conversation to go on for a short time then tried to get the students focused, which they could not do and ran out of time in the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, I learned what activities the teachers have found the most effective assignments.  Every teacher allowed the students some time in class to look at the homework assignment for the night and ask questions before they left for the day.  The students seemed to like the chance to get clarification before they were expected to do the assignment on their own.  When answering questions, the teachers never just gave the answers.  They asked the students what they thought was correct and if they were not, the teacher would ask simpler leading questions to guide the student instead of just correcting the mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>What are your recommendations for teachers?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first recommendation to teachers is to be flexible.  The students can learn and they want to, but sometimes they do not know how to best use the information presented to them.  It is the teachers responsibility to help the students develop the skills they need to organize their thoughts and apply their prior knowledge to what they are currently learning.  If the students are not understanding the information, then the teacher has to change the way the information is being presented or explained so the students understand.  It also helps to change the presentation of the material into something that relates to the students‚Äô everyday life.  For example, if the students are not grasping the function a ribosome has in a cell by written explanation alone, a video could be used to show them how the process occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, a teacher has to be open minded.  They have to be willing to learn about their students if they are going to teach them properly.  Each student is different and a teacher is responsible for learning as much about each student as possible.  If a teacher focuses on the way just a few students learn the best, the rest of the class will not be successful.  When all the homework assignments require copying text from a book, many of the students will do the work but not understand the text or think about what the text says.  Incorporating worksheets with fill-in-the-blanks will make the students read the book and not just write the words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, I would tell anyone who wants to teach to listen.  The students will provide opinions when given the chance. If you continue to teach new information when your students are telling you they do not understand the old material, you are setting them up for failure.  If there is a project that they did not enjoy and you continue to assign the same kind of project, they will not put forth the effort you would expect.  Listening to the students and learning what they do and do not like is especially important for first time teachers.

                  <i>Student Characteristics</i>: Taft High School has a fairly diverse student body with 49.4% of its students being white, 8.9% are Hispanic, and the other 11.7% being Black, Asian, Native American, or Multiracial.  A majority of the students live in low-income families.  A small percent of the students do not speak English as their first language; therefore, they have a limited English due to it not being their first language.  The parents are highly involved with the school with about 94% of the parents having some personal contact with the teachers and administration.  Being in contact with the parents is extremely important for the roughly 17% of the students that have Individualized Education Program.  Finally, in 2012 just over 70% of the senior class graduated.  All data from Illinois Interactive Report Card.

                  <i>Rationale for Unit</i>: During this unit students will explore genetics and learn how microscopic structures determine our physical traits.  This unit is structured so that each day builds on the ones before it. This will help the students build connections between each day‚Äôs material.  The ethics of genetics and its uses are a highly debated topic, and one that may have a great impact on the students‚Äô lives.  Making this unit relevant to their lives will be difficult, but discussing topics such as cloning, genetic engineering, and possible careers will help them see that this is a viable field of study.

                      <i>Rationale</i>: This lesson will provide an introduction about the basic compnents of genetics, DNA and RNA.  Knowing about how these compents replicate will help describe how variations in phenotypes occur.  The students will learn about all the opportunites where a mutation can occur, they can better understand why variations occur.  This lesson will demonstrate how a mutation in the DNA can produce a change in the physical characteristics of an organism.

                      <ul>
                        <li>5 minutes - Introduction: I will begin the day with a video describing how DNA is read and converted to RNA to make proteins that are then transported to various parts of the cell.</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Flow Chart: Based on the video, the students will create a flow chart showing how DNA is used to make proteins.  They will have 5 minutes to create a flow chart on their own then compare their with a partner.  We will spend 5 minutes creating a flow chart as a class to put in their notebook.  They will hand in the flow chart they created.  The chart will serve as a basic framework for the lesson and a definition for gene expression.  ‚ÄúThis whole process of DNA to RNA to proteins is called gene expression</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Mutation Brain Storm: I will ask the student‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen we look at the flow chart, where could a mistake happen?  In how many places could the DNA be misread and have a mutation occur?‚Äù  If no one answers I will ask ‚ÄúWhile reading a book, who misreads a word once in a while?‚Äù I will then be able to start guiding them to think of other processes a mutation can occur.  Once we have a list of the places a mutation can occur I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhy do you think mutations are important? What could a mutation in the DNA cause? What changes could happen because of a mutated protein?‚Äù We will then move on to how DNA is read and turned into RNA and to proteins.<br />‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a look at exactly how gene expression happens, starting with what is DNA made of?‚Äù</li>
                        <li>
                          20 minutes - Gene Expression: I will tell the students that DNA is made of nucleotidess and write the word nucleotide on the board.  We will go over the 4 different nucleotides, Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine.  Next, I will explain how only Adenine and Thymine match and how Guanine and Cytosine can only be paired together.  We will sort the nucleotides into Purines, Cytosine and Thymine, and Pyramidines, Adenine and Guanine.  Comparing the nucleic acids to puzzle pieces, and having paper puzzle pieces to place together, will help make this concept clear.  We will do a few examples on the board as a class where we will build a DNA strand.  Students will have the opportunity to come to the board and write the pairs.  We will move on to RNA by talking about how RNA is made of the same nucleic acids except for Thymine is changed to Uracil.  I will post a picture on the projector that shows the differences.  We will use the same exapmles done for the DNA strands to create RNA strands so the students can see the differences.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhy do you think only Thymine or Uracil can pair with Adenine, or why only Guanine can pair with Cytosine? What could be the purpose of specific pairs?‚Äù We will talk about how mutations can occur here by mispairings.<br /> ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre going to talk about Proteins and how RNA is read in a ribosome to make proteins.‚Äù  We will discuss amino acids and how they are connected to a different kind of RNA that matches to a set of 3 nucleotides.  We will use out previous examples of RNA to split the nucleotides into sets of 3 to show how many combinations there can be.<br />

The second? What happens next? Were there any steps we missed?  What are DNA and RNA made of? What are the names of the nucleotides?  What is different in DNA and RNA? How are proteins made from RNA? How can a mutation occur during this process?‚Äù  All these questions will be put on the overhead for the students to read before I ask each question.<br />A worksheet with more problems the gene expression process will be handed out for homework.</li>

                      <i>Assessment</i>: The student participation at the end of the class will serve as a summative assessment.  If I see students not raising their hands to answer any of the questions or they look nervous, like they do not want to be called on, I will be able to know that they did not quite understand something and I can speak with them.  The homework sheet turned in the next day will serve as another summative assessment and help me pin-point any trouble spots.<br />The flow charts completed during class will be formative assessments so I know if they are getting lost at a particular point.  If many students are confused about the same topic then I will have to explain the point again the next day.

                      Mike: Have a copy of the homework worksheet already highlighted for him to take home.  I will write in his daily planner that the worksheet is due the next day and to check the initial from his parents from the previous day‚Äôs assignment.  I will give him a chance to come to the board and write so he has the opportunity to be moving around the room.  I will seat him with a partner who will help keep him on task, one of the more motivated students with a strong desire to learn.  If he continues to get off task I will walk and stand by his desk.<br />
                      Joann: At the end of the class I will talk through the homework assignment and go over the directions with her.  I will be using the large puzzle pieces on the board and give her some small ones for her own use at home.  The video will also be a good visual aid for her to see the whole process.  I will write in her assignment book the assignment and tell her that I need her parents to initial the assignment book.  I will provide her with a full copy of the notes she should have in her notebook to take home.  I will give her a vocabulary chart with definitions at the beginning of the unit separated by the day we will cover the word.<br />
                      Mercedes:  All the important topics, vocabulary, and notes will be written for her to copy down.  I will leave everything on the board as long as I can and check she has the notes before erasing them.  I will talk slowly and keep the class at a pace she can follow.  She will also receive a copy of the vocabulary chart for the semester with a column she can use to describe the words in her first language.<br />
                      Rafael:  When Rafael raises his hand to participate I will do my best to call on him without calling on only him to get him involved in class and help develop his social skills.  I will try to seat him next to someone who is more understanding and patient with his social skills.<br />
                      John: I will ask John to do a little extra on his homework and research the different kinds of mutations that can occur during gene expression and give me a definition and example of each.

                      <ul>
                        <li>The student will be able to define the laws of segregation, independent assortment and dominance.</li>
                        <li>The student will be able to describe why Gregor Mendel was important to the field of genetics.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      <i>Rationale</i>: Discussing how traits are passed from one generation to another is the foundation of genetics.  Gergor Mendel‚Äôs pea experiments and laws of genetics were a major turning point in the field of genetics.  Students will have a basic understanding of Mendel‚Äôs laws after this lesson which will be essential when discussing how DNA, chromosomes, and genes, previously discussed, determine physical traits in organisms.

                      <ul>
                        <li>5 minutes - Introduction: After the lesson on mutations and gene expression, we will move into Mendel‚Äôs Laws and why he is called the ‚ÄúFather of genetics‚Äù.  Small paper cups with M&Ms will be handed out to the students.  The student will split a piece of paper in half and write an M on the top of one side and and F on the top of the other.  They will be asked to close their eyes and pick 2 candies and place them together on the M side of the paper then pick 2 more candies and put them on the F side.  Under the M&Ms they will draw 2 circles  on each side and put one candy in each circle.  Next, all of the students will pick and eat 1 candy from each half of the paper.  Finally, on the board, I will make a tally of how many students have 2 of the same color or 1 of each color.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think the M&Ms represent?‚Äù</li>
                        <li>20 minutes - Power Point: Mendel‚Äôs Laws: After completing the demonstration we will start the power point on Mendel‚Äôs laws.
                          <ul>
                            <li>Law of Segregation says that one chromosome of each homologous pair separate so that each gamete has one copy of the trait.  I will then ask the students ‚Äúwhat part of the M&M demonstration do you think represented the Law of Segregation?‚Äù  The law of segergation is demonstrated by placing the M&Ms in the circles representing the gametes.  What an allele is will be explained and the students will be told that each color M&M represents a different allele of the same trait.  A brief review of meiosis will be included to refresh students‚Äô memories.</li>
                            <li>Law of Independent Assortment states that which trait is inherited is based on chance.  I will again ask the students which part of the demonstration showed independent assortment?  The probability of them picking and eating either candy was 50/50.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between Independent assortment and segregation?‚Äù and use a think-pair-share method.</li>
                            <li>Law of Dominance says that one allele will be dominant and one will be recessive.  Traits can be paired in homogeneous pairs or heterogeneous pairs.  Homogeneous pairs can then be further classified into homogeneous dominant or homogeneous recessive.  Also discussed here will be the important difference between genotype and phenotype.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Group Activity: In small groups, the students will write a summary of the M&M demonstration.  They will state how each step fits into each of Mendel‚Äôs laws.</li>
                        <li>20 minutes - Power Point: Gregor Mendel and his Peas: The slides will include information about Mendel and give an introduction to his pea plant experiments.</li>
                        <li>5 minutes - Closure: After the Mendel power point, I will ask students to write on a piece of paper thier own definition of each of Mendel‚Äôs laws and why they think the law is important.  They will also include a few sentences about why Mendel is called the ‚Äúfather of genetics.‚Äù</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Assessment</i>: For pre-assessment I will ask the students ‚ÄúHow do the M&Ms relate to genetics?‚Äù to determine if they have been introduced to genetics before.  If all they answer is we separated them and ate them, then I know they have not been introduced to the laws of genetics.  I will be looking for the students to reference the M&M demonstration in their answers as a way of describing the different laws.  At the end of the class I plan to check their definitions of each of Mendel‚Äôs laws and see if the demonstration worked or there was confusion about the laws.

                      Joann: At the end of the class I will talk through the homework assignment and go over the directions with her.  I will provide her with a full copy of the Power Point she should have in her notebook to take home.  I will give her a vocabulary chart with definitions at the beginning of the unit separated by the day we will cover the word.<br />
                      Mercedes: All the important topics, vocabulary, and notes will be written for her to copy down.  A copy of the power point will be given to her.  I will talk slowly and keep the class at a pace she can follow.  She will also receive a copy of the vocabulary chart for the semester with a column she can use to describe the words in her first language.<br />

                      <i>Rationale</i>: This lesson will go into more depth about how traits are passed from parent to offspring.  It will expand why dominance and recessive traits are important and how they can be tracked to tell about a person‚Äôs heritage.  They will also learn the importance of knowing you family‚Äôs medical history and why doctors ask.

                      <i>Instructional Procedure</i>:<br />
                      <ul>
                        <li>3 minutes - Introduction: ‚ÄúYesterday, we learned about Punnett squares and the probability that an offspring would have what traits based on what their parents‚Äô phenotypes were.  Today, we‚Äôre going to expand that to a whole family tree.‚Äù As a class we will brainstorm the definition of inheritance.</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Vocabulary Power Point: I will briefly lecture about the correct definition of inheritance and the different kinds of inheritance; autosomal and sex-linked.  One slide will introduce what a pedigree is, what it means to be a carrier, and the symbols used on a pedigree chart.  Karyotypes will also be defined and introduced as a way to determine if a person has a genetic mutation.</li>
                        <li>15 minutes - Pedigree lab: In small groups, the students will complete a worksheet with different pedigree trees.  I will be walking around the class and assisting any group with questions.  The students will be asked to complete filling in the pedigree and determinine if the trait being studied is sex-linked or autosomal.</li>
                        <li>20 minutes - Karyotype lab: Students will chose one of 5 karyotypes to perform.  They will cut out the chromosomes and pair them together.  They will tape the pairs together to a sheet of paper and try to determine if there is a mutation in the person‚Äôs chromosomes.  The labs will be collected and I will reveal what karyotypes had a mutation and, if they did, what the mutation was.  I will be monitoring the students‚Äô progress and answering questions.</li>
                        <li>2 minutes - Closure: I will ask the student to go home and think about, or research, about human genetics and the disorders that people can have because of a mutation.  They should also write a few sentences about how pedigrees and karyotypes can be used to show what disease a person may have.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Assessment</i>: Asking for their definitions of inheritance will serve as a pre-assessment and tell me if the students have been introduced to the topic previously or have only had the previous lessons.  The labs will serve as a summative assessments and determine if the students can differentiate between the different kinds of inheritance.

                      <i>Modifications</i>:<br />
                      Mike: Have a copy of the labs already highlighted for him to work on.  I will write in his daily planner that he needs to do some research at home and I need his parents to initial the planner.  I will give him a chance to move around the room while working with a group on the labs.<br />
                      Joann: At the end of the class I will talk through the homework assignment and go over the directions with her.  I will write in her assignment book the assignment and tell her that I need her parents to initial the assignment book.  I will provide her with a full copy of the notes she should have in her notebook to take home.  I will give her a vocabulary chart with definitions at the beginning of the unit separated by the day we will cover the word.  To help her with the pedigree lab, I will give her small circles and squares for her to move and manipulate.<br />
                      Mercedes: All the important topics, vocabulary, and notes will be written for her to copy down.  I will give her a physical copy of the power point to include in her notes.  I will talk slowly and keep the class at a pace she can follow.  She will also receive a copy of the vocabulary chart for the semester with a column she can use to describe the words in her first language.<br />
                      Rafael:  I will try to seat him next to someone who is more understanding and patient with his social skills.  I will have to pay extra attention to his group and make sure he is participating and learning how to interact with the other students.<br />
                      John: I will assign an article to read and reflect on an article about inheritance instead of researching genetic diseases.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Extension</i>: If we complete the labs early I will ask the students to create their own pedigrees and give them to a partner to solve.

                        <li>5 minutes - Introduction: I will have a question on the board for an entry slip asking the students to define ‚Äúgenetic disorder.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Article: We will start with a read aloud of a short article about professional athletes and genetic disorders.  The students will take turns reading a short section.  At the end we will discuss other athletes they have heard of that have a genetic disease.  Finally, I will pass out a sheet with a list of genetic disorders and what they are caused by.</li>
                        <li>15 minutes - Common Genetic Disorders: During this time I will ask the students to share if they know someone with a genetic disease.  We will talk in depth about people with Down Syndrome, Alzheiners, Cystic Fibrosis, and Sick Cell Anemia.  I will write on the board the 5 disorders I want them to know about, the incidence rate, and what the mutation is that causes the disease.<br />‚ÄúIf you would like to know more about your genetic background there are some projects out there that are trying to build a database of people‚Äôs genomes.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Human Genome Project: We will talk about what the Human Genome Project is and how the project could be important.  I will show them the website and we can discuss what the possible outcomes and advances in Genetics the project could provide.  We will talk about some of the ethical problems the project website lists (<a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml">Link</a>).<br />‚ÄúNext, we‚Äôll talk about a way you can get your DNA sequenced.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>5 minutes - 23 and Me: This is a service that you can pay for to get your DNA sequenced.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhy might you want to get your DNA sequenced?‚Äù  I will show the students the site and what services it offers.</li>
                        <li>5 minutes - Closure: I will ask the students to choose a side about whether or not it is fair to gender test professional athletes.  I also would ask them to describe 3 genetic disorders and state their cause.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      <i>Assessment</i>: Discussing all the different kinds of genetic disorders with the students will serve as a pre-assessment and their input to the discussion will give me an idea of their backgrounds with the disorders.  The entry slip will be a diagnostic assessment.  It will allow me to guide the discussion better determine if they understood the information from the previous lesson.

                      Mike: I will give him a chance to move around the room while rearranging the desks to facilitate a class discussion.  If he begins to talk out of turn I will, first walk near him to remind him that his classmate is talking.  If he continues to talk I will verbally remind him that he needs to wait to share his opinion.<br />
                      Joann: I will provide her with a full copy of the the notes, with a highlighted list of the genetic disorders, she should have in her notebook to take home.<br />
                      Mercedes: I will write all the important points and topics on the board for her to copy down.  I will also provide her with a copy of the article before class so she can spend some time pre-reading it and will be prepared to read aloud in class.<br />
                      Rafael:  I will have to watch Rafael while the classroom is being rearranged and make sure he is cooperating with the other students and that he is not sitting too close to his neighbor.<br />
                      John: I will ask John to help me lead the discussions.  Have him help me move the conversation along if the other students are nervous about participating.

                      <ul>
                        <li>The student will be able to describe events where people were discriminated against based on physical traits such as race.</li>
                        <li>The student will be able to discuss how genetics and family history lead to discrimination.</li>
                        <li>The student will be able to relate the science of genetics and societal views about phenotypes.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <i>Rationale</i>: This lesson will be an interdisplinary lesson between science and history.  The students will be discusing Social Darwinism in the context of the Spanish-American War.  We will look at the scientific part of Social Darwinism and other examples of discrimination based on a person‚Äôs phenotype.

                      <ul>
                        <li>5 minutes - Introduction: I will ask the students ‚ÄúI know you have been talking about the Spanish-American War in your history classes.  What was that war about?‚Äù  After having a few students answer I will ask ‚ÄúCan anyone guess what Social Darwinism means?‚Äù</li>
                        <li>10 minutes - Definition of Social Darwinism: I will have one Power Point slide that has the definition of Social Darwinism.  The second slide will have the question ‚ÄúWhat makes one group of people inferior to another group?‚Äù  I will list their responses on the board.  Finally, I will ask the students for historical examples of one group being superior to another and listing their responses on the board.<br />I will then ask the students to stand up and line up along the wall with people who agree with Social Darwinism on one end of the wall and people who completely disagree at the other end and ask the rest to fill in where they think they agree.</li>
                        <li>25 minutes - Debate: I will have the students discuss why they think phenotypes should or should not a basis for Social Darwinism.  I will try to guide the discussion to the simple statement that a person‚Äôs genetics leads to discrimination by or of that person.  A ball will be used in this debate to controll the students from shouting over each other.</li>
                        <li>5 minutes - Closure: I will ask the students to write any comments, thoughts, feelings, or ideas they had but did not have the opportunity to share and hand them into me when they are finished.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Assessment</i>: Brainstorming about what they have learned in history and other events that exhibit Social Darwinism will be a pre-assessment and help me determine how involved I will have to be in the discussion.  The debate about the concept of Social Darwinism will serve as a formative assessment and tell if the students complete understand the idea.  The reflection about the debate at the end of class will serve as a summative assessment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Modifications</i>:<br />
                      Mike: I will give him a chance to move around the room while rearranging the desks to facilitate a class discussion and when the students line up on the wall to tell their agreement or disagreement with Social Darwinism.  If he begins to talk out of turn I will, first walk near him to remind him that his classmate is talking.  The ball will help to keep him physically doing something while participating in the discussion.<br />
                      Joann: I will provide her with a print out of the Power Point to put in her notebook.<br />
                      Mercedes: I will give her a copy of the Power Point in advance so she can look up the term and have a better understanding before coming to class to discuss the topic.<br />
                      Rafael: I will have to make sure Rafael is participating in the discussion and not reading his book.  Asking for his opinion specifically may help him to get involved.<br />
                      John: I will ask John to help me guide the discussion.  Having him help me move the conversation along if the other students are nervous about participating.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>Extension</i>: I will ask the students to help be analyze my earlier statement that genetics leads to discrimination.  It will give me the opportunity to reiterate some of the main points of the unit such as the difference between genotype and phenotype and how traits are passed from one generation to the next.

                <p>
                  <i>Introduction / Rationale</i>: The complex human form is an important topic for students to understand, both to reinforce previously learned biological knowledge, and to discuss the underlying forces at work that allow us to live. Young students have changing bodies and, over the course of their lives, will experience many positive and negative events related to the human body. A ¬†broad overview ¬†of the subject will contextualize the student‚Äôs own experience, while detailed study of organ systems will foster critical connections between separate systems. The integration of the broad and detailed will foster understanding of how complex systems work together to maintain the overall function of the body. Making connections between minutiae and an aggregated whole is a highly transferrable concept and will be useful to students throughout their lives.

                <p>
                  <i>Big Ideas and Critical Concepts</i>: We would like students to learn how complex systems work together to regulate temperature, and nutrient balance through both positive and negative feedback to achieve homeostasis.<br />
                  We would like students to retain a general understanding of the human body plan and a basic understanding of the major components of the major organ systems; nervous, skeletal, endocrine, reproductive, immune, circulatory, digestive, integumentary, and muscular.<br />
                  Students will learn that biological form often follows function as they make connections between human organ systems and similar strategies in other animals.

                    <li><i>The Hot Zone</i> is a true story about a deadly virus that is a mutation aof the Ebola virus that causes a hemorrhagic fever and makes its way from the central African rain forest into the suburbs of Washington D.C. A SWAT team of military professionals and scientists are called for secret operation to contain the virus. This book describes how viruses infect the human body and certain lethal viruses can make their way into a whole human race. The purpose of using this book in class would be to make students aware of the many microorganisms that can affect our immune system. It would be read when the class starts the chapters on the immune system and how diseases can affect our bodies.<br />

                    <li><i>The Spark of Life</i> is a book that describes the role of electrical impulses in the human body. These electrical impulses drive our muscles to move, our thoughts, our hearts to beat. This book introduces how scientist first discovered the role of electricity in the human body. This book also includes a series of experiments performed to show or describe these electrical impulses. The purpose of using this book during the class would aid students in a greater understanding of the electrical impulses that drive structures in our body to function such as the brain, heart, muscle contractions, gastrointestinal tract, etc.<br />

                    <li><i>Musicophelia, Tales of Music and the Brain,</i>¬†by Oliver Sacks, is a compilation of many case studies of people with a neurological disorder that induces odd behavior or motivation surrounding music. Although this book is geared towards adult, and at times the vocabulary can be challenging, the chapters are short and broken into discrete bits that one could read as a stand-alone section. This book makes great connections between the brain and the nervous system and how behavior can be changed due to some change to the nervous system. This book would be appropriate as independent reading, or a short section of the book could be used during the lesson on the nervous system.<br />

Set in a cold-war style conflict of the future, a team must travel in a miniaturized submarine through the circulatory system of an enemy defector. This defector has been severely injured in an attempt to sabotage the defection and the team must race against the clock in order to save the man‚Äôs life.<br />
                    This book would be an appropriate resource for secondary and high school students to use as an independent reading activity. It contains anatomical details throughout the book that connect directly to the circulatory and organ systems outlined in the unit.<br />

                    <li>In <i>Building a Human on a Chip, Organ by Organ</i> written by Jessica Hamzelu in New Scientist magazine, the author describes a novel way of creating cell cultures that allows scientists to investigate cell functions and interactions that would have been missed in traditional cell culture. The article goes on to discuss the increasingly sophisticated systems that scientists are creating in order to model human body function. The eventual aim is to connect these ‚Äúorgans‚Äù into something that resembles the functionality of the body. In this way, findings from studies testing new drugs or harmful pathogens can be translated to humans without the worry of inadequate models such as mice. ¬†This article ties in nicely with our unit on Anatomy and Physiology by contextualizing what the students will be learning. Knowledge of form and function is very important, and this is a major concept of this article.<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to assess students‚Äô background knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, a short survey will be distributed and completed by the students before the first lesson. This will give the students a preview of ¬†the material and concepts that they will be learning about, and also provide the teacher with some idea about how much review should be done prior to beginning the unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would also suggest that the answers from this informal assessment be discussed as a group upon completion. This will allow students who may have forgotten material, or been intimidated by some of the information that they weren‚Äôt familiar with to clarify and elaborate on background knowledge. This informal assessment will help to focus the class to the task of learning the new material.

                  <i>Student motivation</i>:With the aim of increasing student motivation and interest in the material in this unit, we will take a moment early in the unit to discuss practical implications of knowing about human body structure and function. We will discuss possible careers, pathologies, and general implications on health.<br />
                  Also, as a strategy to motivate interest in the text, we have created a graphic organizer that will function as a reference that will help keep the students organized during the unit. The examples presented with this unit plan will be distributed at the beginning of each section of the unit. Students will note connections in the specific system and also connections to the other systems. These will be used for reference and review throughout the unit. ¬†These graphic used on the organizers was adapted from ck12.org. <a href="http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Biology-Concepts/r18/section/13.1/#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTAxLUxldmVscy1vZi1Pcmdhbml6YXRpb24">http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Biology-Concepts/r18/section/13.1/#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTAxLUxldmVscy1vZi1Pcmdhbml6YXRpb24</a>

                  <i>Schema Activation:</i> Schema activation is an important concept to remember for teaching high school students. Schema activation requires students to think about knowledge they already know. It is a process in which new information is integrated into a network of prior knowledge. During schema activation, students make connections to previously learned material and see how they can apply prior knowledge to new acquired knowledge. In order to get students thinking about the lesson, they need to draw conclusions and think about what they know about the topic prior to the lesson. There are several ways to activate schema in students. One technique is the K-W-L technique. For this technique, students will have a sheet to fill out and write what they know about the topic, what they want to know about the topic, and what they learned about the topic (Fisher & Frey, 2012).<br />
                  The K-W-L technique can be used during the start of each chapter or for each assigned reading for sections in Anatomy and Physiology. At the start of each section in the chapter, students are to fill out what they know about the topic prior to reading. Students will also fill out what they want to know about the topic. Students can include questions or concerns they have on the topic. After the lesson is taught and students read the necessary texts, students are to write what they learned. After the students fill out the chart, they will write a paragraph on how well they knew the topic.<br />

                  <i>Anticipation:</i> Displays are essential to effective teaching in human anatomy. ¬†If the students never see what they are supposed to be learning about, how can they relate the learning to themselves? ¬†A visual display could be used before each major body system including the skeletal system, muscular system, cardiovascular system and the nervous system. ¬†The display would be shown to the students and explained during the lesson before the reading on the chapter. ¬†An example would be having a life-sized skeleton for the skeletal system or a full-length map of the cardiovascular system, diagram from wynnpress.com. ¬†We could then discuss what the students know about the system we will be studying.<br />
                  A demonstration could be used to make a lesson memorable and help the students internalize the information. ¬†For example, before reading about how the nervous system controls the voluntary muscles, students can use a Portable STIM machine on their arm or leg and experience the electricity going through the muscles and watching the muscles contract. ¬†Then a discussion about why the connection between muscles and brain is important and what is its purpose.<br />

                <p>
                  <i>Vocabulary Strategies:</i> Vocabulary charts are useful for an assessment of prior knowledge and as a tool for reflection. ¬†A vocabulary chart can be made and used throughout the entire human anatomy unit. ¬†There are terms in anatomy that are common or multiple or all of the systems. ¬†Use of the chart will help students to connect the systems together by recognizing what terms are used in which systems. ¬†Also, as the unit progresses, they can revise their list to include examples for multiple systems. ¬†Knowing these general terms will also help in some of the units when they may be required to determine the location of an organ or muscle based on the name, such as vastus lateralis and vastus medialis being on the outside or inside of the leg, respectively.<br />
                  Another vocabulary strategy we would implement in the unit is a word search. A word search is an interactive way students can learn vocabulary words by filling in the blanks for the definition. After the students fill in the blanks, they would find them in the word search. Word searches can be used in each chapter. The following words and definitions are based from a chapter on the Skeletal, Muscular, and Integumentary Systems.

                  Post reading comprehension strategies are important tools to incorporate in the classroom. Post reading comprehension strategies assist students in the summarization and reflection of reading. By reflection and summarization, students can better understand the material that they read. Post reading comprehension strategies can help students organize material so that it can be understood. A post reading comprehension strategy that is effective in the classroom is Cornell notes (Fisher & Frey, 2012). The purpose of Cornell notes is to organize what is read. This comprehension strategy can be used in all chapters of anatomy and physiology. Anatomy and physiology pose many important ideas that need to be understood, so this strategy should be done after each chapter that the students read. This strategy is organized includes two categories, big ideas and details and notes. This allows students to identify the big ideas in the text and then expand on it by writing details and notes.<br />

                  Writing to learn is an active process that enhances further learning. Writing to learn teaches students how recall, clarify, and question what they know and what they want to know (Fisher & Frey, 2012). Writing to learn helps students to express in words what they are learning and helps them understand how they are learning.<br />
                  One example of writing to learn that can be used in the classroom is based on questioning and assessing. In the anatomy and physiology class, the use of entry slips will be used at the beginning of each class period (Fisher & Frey, 2012). This method will help focus the students about the lesson. Before the start of each class, students are to fill out an entry slip based on a statement or idea that will be written on the board. The statement or idea that will be written on the board will be the main focus or main topic of lesson. Students are to write anything they know about the topic. Students can also write questions that they may have about the statement or idea.<br />

                  Human anatomy and physiology are rich and complex subjects. Very often, long and complicated names of organs and organ systems do not readily translate into catchy mnemonics or other easily memorized bits. It is therefore vital to use quality visual aids to reinforce details associated with anatomy and physiology. To this end, we have identified some excellent online resources that will reinforce concepts and details.<br />
                  Throughout the course of the unit, periodic stopping points (once per organ system) will serve as appropriate places to take the class to the school‚Äôs computer lab. While there, they will be given a quarter of the class time to explore human anatomy in a self-directed fashion at <a href="http://zygotebody.com/">http://zygotebody.com/</a>. The remainder of the class will be given over to completing the game associated with the most recently covered subject at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/</a>.<br />
                  These games require students to respond to challenges on a visual model of the human body. Upon completion of the game, the student will be given a score. The students will be asked to repeat the activity until they have achieved an appropriate score (scores may vary due to the difficulty of different activities). The final score will be recorded and used as part of the unit assessment.

                  Asking yourself questions while reading ensures that you are focused on the text and taking time to think about what you are reading. ¬†A SQ3R, survey, question, read, recite, and review, helps promote a student‚Äôs reading by making them preview the chapter, skim the material to find the important details, and set a purpose for doing the reading before actually reading (Fisher & Frey, 2012 p. 94). ¬†When the student surveys the material, they should be making predictions of what they think the text is about, it will also activate their prior knowledge about the topic. ¬†The questions they form will be about what they think will be in the text. ¬†Reading, combined with prior knowledge, will help the student construct an understanding of the content. ¬†When the students recite the answers to their own questions, they have to think about if their answer makes sense, and answers the question they asked. ¬†Reviewing is important for them to clarify their understanding and answer any leftover questions. ¬†Recitation and reviewing will help the students learn what information they understand and what kind of material they need to spend extra time on. ¬†An SQ3R can be used for any chapter or research article assigned to the students.

                  While visiting Lincoln Park High school, I was able to witness how teachers communicate with high school students.  These communications can affect how a student behaves and performs in a classroom.  Out of the ten hours of observations I completed, three are described here.  Observation 1 describes the classroom setting and something being taught in the classroom.  Observation 2 will narrate how a teacher communicates with the class.  The last observation will tell how a teacher interacts with one student.  Each observation is followed by an interpretation of the described events.

                  Lincoln Park High School is not a typical Chicago Public School (CPS) school.  It is a neighborhood school and a magnet school.  This means that some of the students are selected to attend while others go because they are zoned to attend the school.  The school is split into two buildings.  The main building has most of the classes for all grades while the other is called the ‚ÄúFreshman Building‚Äù because all the classes there are for the Freshman.  The freshman do have classes in the main building but they have to move between the buildings throughout the day.  The demographics of the school, according to Illinois Interactive Report Card, are fairly evenly distributed with 26% and 27% being White and Black respectively, 31% are Hispanic, 11% are Asian, 4% are identified as Multiracial, and .3% are American Indian.  More than half of the student population come from low-income families.  Just under 7% of the students have an Independent Education Program (IEP).  The graduation rate at Lincoln Park is high with just over 85% of the students graduating in 2012.

                  The teacher is a young, white man wearing  a collared, button-up shirt with khaki slacks.  There are 26 students in the class, 13 girls and 13 boys.  Out of the girls: 10 are White, 2 are Black, and 1 is Hispanic.  Of the boys: 8 are White, 1 is Black, and 3 are Hispanic.

                  When you walk in the classroom there are two rows of lab benches with eight benches in each row, each bench seats two students.  The rows of benches face a chalk board, on the West wall that is blocked by a projector screen.  The teacher‚Äôs desk and a projector are in front of the chalk board.  The room is approximately 30 feet by 60 feet.  Windows line the South wall, opposite of the door; the blinds are mostly closed so only some sunlight gets and makes the room mostly dark.  Under the window is a counter with cabinets underneath runs from one end of the room to another; it is covered with experiments, glassware, and sinks.  On the East side of the door are more counters with sinks and the cabinets on the wall above the counter are filled with glassware, microscopes, and text books.  To the west of the door the wall juts out.  The walls contain posters showing cartoon animals promoting lab safety such as ‚ÄúWear your goggles to protect your eyes.‚Äù  There is another door in the back of the classroom that is locked.  A map of the room is included on the last page.

                <p>
                  The schedule for the day is on the projector when the students walk in.  The teacher is leaning against the counter by the windows next to some plants under a UV light.  After the bell rings, he begins to talk about the experiment the students have been working on involving plants and the amount of fertilizer you can add until it dies.  He asks the students ‚ÄúWhat does Simple Green say you can do with it?‚Äù  A female student answers ‚ÄúYou can drink it.‚Äù  The teacher responds ‚ÄúYou can drink it yet it only takes a small amount to kill the plant.‚Äù  He then directs attention to the projector screen displaying a slide that only says LD50.  The students are asked to take two minutes to write what they think LD50 means. The teacher walks around the classroom reading every students‚Äô answer and putting a stamp on their paper.  The students are all quiet during the two minutes.  One student is singled out for having the best answer and asked to read it aloud.  The class then discussed what LD50 means, and doing a ranking activity that asks the students to put nicotine, alcohol, salt, and sucrose in an order from the highest, or safest, LD50 to the lowest LD50.  The answers are discussed in small groups before the class discussion.

                <p>
                  Task A: classroom climate.  The classroom was conditioning the students to enjoy learning Environmental Science through Pavlov‚Äôs classical conditioning. When walking into the classroom, it is spacious and the posters on the walls are humorous and help you to relax.  It is a little dark because the lights are off to allow you to see the agenda on the projector screen.  The blinds let in enough light to keep the room comfortably lit.  The teacher is relaxed, he leans on the counter at the side of the room instead of standing at the front, which would be more authoritarian.  His demeanor could keep the students relaxed.  They respect his classroom since they are all on task when he asks them to be writing down their thoughts and not talking to friends.  The room is classically conditioning the students to like studying Environmental Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The unconditioned stimulus (UCS) is the classroom and the unconditioned response (UCR) is the students feeling relaxed when they enter the room.  Another UCS could be the teacher‚Äôs behavior and his relaxed stance when addressing the class and the UCR would be the students feeling relaxed.  The conditioned stimulus (CS), in either case, is learning Environmental Science and the conditioned response (CR) is feeling relaxed while studying Environmental Science at home.  Generalizing this stimulus would be a student feeling relaxed while studying another similar science course such as Biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Task C: instruction.  The instructional objectives for this class were simple.  The teacher wanted the students to be able to define what Lethal Dose 50.  He also wanted the students to apply LD50 to the experiment to explain their results.  He did not state for the students exactly what the objective was, but the purpose of the lesson was clear.  Both objectives were in the cognitive domain.  Defining LD50 was in the ‚Äúremember‚Äù level of Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy, and applying the information to the experiment was in the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù level (Ormrod, 2011, p. 418).

The bell rings and the teacher begins instruction by talking about the schedule for the day that is written on the white board at the front of the classroom.  The teacher begins with the power point about cell replication.  During her lecture she explains the same idea different ways when the students have a question.  Two of the boys shout out questions and receive answers.  One girl raises her hand, is seen, and the teacher waves her hand and shakes her head.  The teacher frequently tells the class ‚Äúyou will be responsible for knowing [this] for the exam.‚Äù  She also reminds the students of ideas they have already learned by saying, ‚ÄúDo you remember when we learned about...‚Äù  While the teacher is talking the students are copying down the information from the slide displayed on the projector screen.

                <p>
                  After the lecture the class moves onto a note sheet using the book to fill in the blanks.  The teacher walks around the room checking their progress.  She spends about 5 minutes with a group of 3 boys to answer questions.  After briefly checking a few more groups she stops everyone to say, ‚ÄúI have noticed that many of you are making the same mistake.‚Äù  She has the class write on their sheets the correct answer for the problem question.  Eventually, the teacher sits at her desk at the front of the room and tells the class ‚ÄúWhat you do not finish is homework.‚Äù  Some of the students continue to work with a partner on the note sheet, others begin to talk to classmates.

                <p>
                  Task B: individual and group differences.  The teacher is not aware of her behavior and how she may be communicating to her students that they boys are more important than the girls.  She only answered the questions that were shouted at her but the girl that waited patiently to have her question answered was waved down.  I think the teacher dismissed her question because she was planning on going more in depth about the topic she was lecturing on and may answer her question; however, it also could have been for a lack of time.  The teacher wanted to give the students time to complete the note sheet in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The teacher also spent more time working with the all boy group than she did with another group.  Spending time with the boys may discourage the girls and make them think that they should just understand science and their questions are not as engaging as the questions the boys are asking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Task F: case study or article.  This situation reminds me of Case 8 ‚ÄúGuys and Dolls‚Äù from Educational Psychology Cases by Greenwood, Fillmer, and Parkay (2002).  In the case study there are multiple examples were various teachers explicitly directs the boys and girls to stations or activities that better fit stereotypical gender rolls (Greenwood et al., 2002, p 78-85).  In a science classroom, spending more time with boys, or only answering their questions, is an implicit way of getting the girls to think that science is a man‚Äôs field.  The teacher probably does not notice she is promoting these gender roles by doing something as simple as answering questions.

                  The teacher is a middle-aged, white, female.  She is asking each student how the basketball game went the night before or what their plans are for the weekend.  The bell rings and the students are quiet as the teacher begins a lecture with a slide show.  She asks the students the question on the slide ‚ÄúWhat do the following have in common?‚Äù  The students begin to shout out answers.  The teacher hears a boy sitting next to her, John, mumble something.  She asks him ‚ÄúWhat did you say [John]?‚Äù  He replies ‚ÄúNothin.‚Äù She leans over to him and says, ‚ÄúYou can just tell me.‚Äù  To which he responds ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù  The teacher continues with the lecture.  On one slide the students are asked to go to the computer and balance an equation; the teacher calls on John to ask him to go and he refuses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the power point, the students are given a worksheet to complete with a partner.  The teacher gives the class a few minutes to write some answers before walking around the classroom.  She stops at John‚Äôs desk and checks his answers.  She quietly tells him, ‚ÄúKeep up the good work, you‚Äôre getting better,‚Äù then she continues to visit with the other groups.  A few minutes later the class begins to get loud and the teacher says, ‚Äúmake sure you‚Äôre completing your worksheet.‚Äù  The students quiet down and return to the worksheet.

                <p>
                  Task D: motivation.  The teacher praising John‚Äôs worksheet follows Carol Dweck‚Äôs advise from her article ‚ÄúThe Perils and Promises of Praise‚Äù about praising effort and not intelligence (Cauley & Pannozzo, 2013, p 189).  This could be a student that thinks he knows but is not quiet sure.  The teacher is trying to get him to believe that he is good at Chemistry and that he knows more than he thinks; she wants to put him in a ‚Äúgrowth mind-set‚Äù (Cauley & Pannozzo, 2013, p 189).  By encouraging his effort, the teacher hopes to build his confidence and have him actively participate in class.  Currently, John has low motivation because his expectations for himself are low, how much he values education could not be determined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  John‚Äôs lack of confidence could indicate that he is attributing his failures to his intelligence, from his point of view, it is an internal, stable, and uncontrollable attribution.  The teacher is trying to change his mind set by encouraging his effort and help him realize that he can  increase his intelligence.  John does not appear to have any positive intrinsic motivators.  The teacher is trying to give him extrinsic motivators such as praise and good grades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Task E: classroom management.  The teacher cues her students to continue working and stop talking to friends when she reminds them what they are supposed to be spending their time working on.  She also prevents behavior problems in her classroom by using interactive power points to keep the students engaged and focused.  
                  Jacob Kounin defined the term withitness to describe a teacher that knows everything that goes on in their classroom at all times (Ormrod, 2011, p 472).  The teacher could improve on her withitness since she had to wait until the class became loud before realizing that the students were off task.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Task G: experiment.  I would like to determine if, in high school students, praising the effort of a group has a greater affect on their motivation than praising individual efforts.  I believe that praising an individual‚Äôs effort will have a greater affect because in a group some people may slack off and still get praised for other people‚Äôs work.  I predict that when praising a group, the students that do most of the work and do not slack will have an increase in motivation.  The students that slack off, or are asked not to do a lot of work, will probably have no change or a decrease in their motivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, I would randomly assign the teachers a technique, individual or group praise.  Next, I would pre-test the students motivation with a self-response questionnaire and ask the teachers to rate their students motivation.  The questionnaire will include questions asking about the student‚Äôs expectations and how they value education.  After 2 months I would give the students and teachers the same questionnaires and determine which students had an increase, no change, or decrease in their motivation.  Testing the students and teachers is important because the students may lie on the questionnaire and the teachers can misinterpret cultural differences in their students; they may think that students that do not participate much in class are not motivated.
                  The independent variable in this experiment will be the method of praise used by the teacher.  The change in the students motivation is the dependent variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>Summary and Conclusion</h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would have liked the opportunity to see more power point presentations from the female teacher in Observation 3.  The students really seemed to enjoy learning about chemistry and getting the opportunity to interact with the teacher and power point as the topic was being explained.  The only thing I would do differently, if I were her, would be to be more aware of what the students are doing at all times.  The students appeared to respect her since they returned to work when she reminded them what they were working on.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also liked the teacher from the first observation.  He had many assessments worked into his lesson plan such as checking their guesses for what LD50 meant and the ranking activity the students performed in small groups.  I like these kinds of formative and diagnostic assessments because it gives you the ability to change the direction of the lesson based on what you see your students are, and are not, understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The teacher in the second observation was not the kind of teacher I would strive to be like.  She seemed disinterested in most of her students except for a few, for example spending more time with the group of boys.  She also seemed more worried about giving them time to complete homework in class instead of clarifying ideas to make the homework easier like when she waved off the question from the girl student.

Mental images can be put on paper by choosing a graphic organizer such as a concept map, flow chart, or a Venn diagram.  Today, we will be using a Venn diagram to compare the characteristics f two objects.  Venn diagrams allow you to organize characteristics that are common to both objects and ones that are different.

                      Let‚Äôs start with something that we have already learned.  I‚Äôm going to do a Venn diagram that compares prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  The first thing I need to do is draw 2 circles and make sure that they overlap a little bit in the middle.  Now, I want to label one circle prokaryotes and one eukaryotes.  Let me think a minute here.  Both of these things have a cell wall and DNA so both of those will go in the overlap area.  Since they both also have DNA they need ribosomes to read the DNA and make proteins, so ribosomes can go in the middle too.<br />
                      Let‚Äôs fill in the prokaryote circle with what we know about prokaryotes.  They are single cell organisms, they do not have a nucleus or organelles.  Prokaryotes are capable of living in extremely environments. Why can they live in extremely hot and cold environments?  They‚Äôre DNA can change and mutate quickly. I should write that down too. That‚Äôs enough for now, if I think of more I can add it.  Now I want to think about Eukaryotes.  They have nuclei and organelles.  What fills a cell? Cytoplasm! Cytoplasm should go in the overlap since both kinds of cells are filled with cytoplasm.  How do cell reproduce? Prokaryotes usually reproduce by binary fission and eukaryotes undergo mitosis.<br />
                      Okay, Let‚Äôs do another one together.

                  I found writing this lesson plan stressful and exciting I also found the process to be long and more difficult than I expected.  It would have been easier if I had access to a high school text book or a school‚Äôs curriculum created by a department to use as a guideline.  I used what I could recall but I was not sure what was too advanced for high school and what was appropriate.

                  Many of the comments from my classmates mentioned my opening activity with the M&Ms and how they liked it.  Some mentioned that it got their attention others stated how it helped them to focus.  The M&M activity was also popular because it was hands on.  One person mentioned that they could see how passionate I was about the topic, which made me excited because genetics is one of my favorite topics.  Another mentioned that they liked my summary activity where I asked everyone to write about the M&Ms demonstration.  A few people stated that my pace was too fast.  I know I can talk quickly and have to focus on keeping my pace.  One reason I was going quickly was because I was nervous, another is that I talk very quickly in normal conversation.

                  I wanted to ask more about what my classmates though about the topic, but I forgot to ask.  In the future I will add the questions into my powerpoint to remind myself to ask for class comments and allow students to share what knowledge they already have.  Another change I will make came as a suggestion.  I am going to add the picture of meiosis in between more slides so that I do not have to continuously flip back to the slide with the picture.  Also ideally during the presentation I will be able to use a smart board, otherwise I will get a laser pointer so that I do not block the view of students.

                  When walking up to the school you see many kids getting off the busses that stop at the intersection of Ashland and Foster.  Across the street from the school is a small grocery store that students can be see carrying bags of chips and doughnuts.  When approaching the school from the east you walk past apartment buildings, three-flats, and some single family homes.  Sharing the grounds with the high school is a elementary or middle school.  The rest of the neighborhood consists mostly of apartment buildings and houses.  Students can be seen walking to the school coming from all directions.

                  The inside of the school is traditional and standard for the Chicago Public School (CPS) system.  All the entrances have a security guard with metal detectors and a conveyor belt that the students place their bags on so they can be scanned.  Tall, thin lockers line the hallways and large windows in the stairwells allow natural light.  All the classrooms have the same large windows but the blinds are usually down.  The science classrooms are equip with lab benches and electrical outlets under each bench.  Each classroom also has a projector at the front of the room and shifting white boards or chalk boards.

                  During the passing periods security guards sit at small computer desks in the hallways and after the bell the tardy students have their ID‚Äôs scanned and are escorted to their classroom.  Many of the classrooms have text book sets for the students to use in the class and another set for them to take home.  The school also has a set of classroom computers that they store on a cart so that they can be used in classrooms.  The teachers lounge has a row of desktops for the faculty to use but there is no other luxury.  Just a few tables and padded chairs to use for small meetings during off periods.  This school‚Äôs staff obviously cares about providing its students with whatever advantages they can.

                  Having only briefly met a few teachers they appear to be enthusiastic about their jobs.  My cooperating teacher (CT) discussed that they are doing the best they can to keep students from dropping out.  He said that when a student drops out the others look at as they escaped and they are lucky they did.  My CT wants to have his students be the center of his instruction and is experimenting this semester with a flipped classroom in his Sophomore Chemistry classes.  He seems to be annoyed by some of the budget restrictions at the school such as if you want copies made the teachers have to supply their own paper.  Since it is the beginning of the year I have overheard a few conversations comparing this year‚Äôs students to last years.  It has been said that the students this year are less willing to learn and more unruly than last year‚Äôs students.

                  As far as technology, I will have access to a projector that connects to my computer.  I can use it for media presentations or power points.  My CT was also able to secure funding, through donations, for a set of tables for his Chemistry classes.  The students will be able to use these tables in class to watch the instructional videos my CT posts on his website.

                <p>
                  <ol style='list-style-type: upper-roman;'>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Procedure:</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <i>Engagement</i>: The first thing will be to briefly review what enzymes are, proteins that catalyze reactions.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhat kind of macromolecule is an enzyme?‚Äù  Then I will begin with a demonstration using the Ball of Whacks and the Play-Doh.  The first part of the demonstration will show the lock-and-key model using only the ball.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhat do you know about the lok-and-key model?‚Äù I will break off a part of the ball to act as the substrate and the rest will be the enzyme.  The hole I make by removing the ‚Äúsubstrate‚Äù will be the activation site and represent the ‚Äúlock‚Äù while the substrate will be the ‚Äúkey.‚Äù  The second part of the demonstration will use the Play-Doh as the enzyme that will form around the substrate.  The final part of the demonstration will extend the induced-fit model by changing the shape of the substrate and using the same shape for the Play-Doh.  This will show that with the induced-fit model one enzyme can react with many substrates. (5 minutes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Exploration</i>: The students will work in groups of 4 students to complete a worksheet with various types of questions and activities, such as a Venn diagram to compare the two models and making an analogy to their daily lives.  The worksheet is one the last page of this plan.  During this time I will walk around the classroom and answer questions as they arise. (20 minutes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Explain</i>: As a class we will create a Venn Diagram on the board comparing the two models after they finish the group work.  At the end, hopefully, the students have included the scientists that invented the theories and we can discuss briefly that long held beliefs can be changed and that it is part of science. (5 minutes)<br />
                          I will ask the groups to share their predictions of the function of each a few types of enzymes: hydrolase, nuclease, protease and synthase. (5 minutes)<br />
                          We will also do a think, pair, share activity where I ask students about the advantages and disadvantages of the induced-fit model.  I will ask them to explain why they think a particular feature is an advantage or disadvantage to encourage them to analyze the information. (10 minutes)<br />
                          We will talk as a class about the nature of science and that as time goes on and others look at a problem or question they may come up with alternative solutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Elaboration</i>: I will ask the groups to come up with an analogy to describe the induced-fit model then share them with the other groups. I will also ask them to discuss why the modifications to the model may have been important.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Evaluate/Assessment</i>: Formal:  I will use the answers to the students‚Äô worksheets to determine understanding of the induced-fit model.<br />
                          Informal: By collaborating with the class I can assess which students may not understand still based on which students are actively participating and which are sitting quietly.  Also, while walking around the room I can assess the quality of the discussion of the groups.  If one person is doing all the talking and the others are just copying the answers I know they are not thinking about the enzyme models.

                      <h5>Differentiated Instruction:</h5>
                      For all the students working with classmates should assist ELL students with words they may not understand.  Special education students will be helped along by classmates while doing the group work.  The talented and gifted students will help the others to understand when they are confused.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Closure:</h5>
                      I will do a brief review using the Play-Doh and the part of the ball, reanimating that enzymes are flexible and can react with various substrates of the same chemical structure.  (1 minute)
                    </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Formal: When checking the ELL and Special Education student‚Äôs worksheets I will focus more on definitions  as a basic understanding.  With talented students I will look for a more detailed response and a deeper understanding than what is required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Informal: I will try to encourage the ELL and Special Education students to begin brainstorm activities so make sure they understand the basics and allow the other students to fill in the gaps.  
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  I will take note of what questions students had the most difficulty with and find another way to word the question to make the students think about the information.

                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Learning how to properly construct a reference list in American Physiological Association (APA) format is essential for scientific writing.  Students need to learn and practice this skill.  Another skill students need to learn is sorting through sources and determining which are reliable and which are not.  The purpose of the lesson was to determine the effectiveness of a short 15 minute discussion.  The class was a junior level International Baccalaureate Biology class at Amundsen High School.  There were 20 students in the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Methods</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The students were give a seven question survey at the beginning of class.  They were told verbally and in writing that the questions would not be graded and that guessing was not penalized.  There was three multiple choice questions and four true or false questions.  A survey was given at the end of the lesson with the same questions but in a different order.  Again the students were told it would not be graded.  To compare the data, the questions on the post-lesson survey were analyzed in the same order as the questions on the pre-lesson survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Data</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Pre-Lesson</i>:  Before the lesson, the students were given a seven question survey and as much time as they needed to finish.  All the students were done within five minutes.  Table 1 shows the survey score before the discussion.  Most of the students, 16, received a 8 or higher out of 11 on the pre-lesson survey.<br />

                <p>
                  Table 2 shows which questions the students go wrong.  Question 1 asked the students ‚Äú What format do you use for science papers?‚Äù and they were asked to choose between MLA or APA.  Question 3 asked the students to choose what kind of websites are the best for research.  They were asked to choose ‚Äúall the apply‚Äù.  Question 5 asked about capitalization of the title in a reference listing.<br />

                  <i>Post-Lesson</i>: After the discussion the students were given as much time as needed to answer all the questions on the survey.  Most students took about three minutes.  Table 3 shows the distribution of scores after the lesson.  All of the students scored at least 8 out of 11, and 13 scored 10 or 11 out of 11.<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                  Table 4 shows which questions were incorrect the most frequently.  Question six was a true or false question that stated if not all information was available for a particular reference, then you do not include it in your bibliography.  Question 3 was frequently incorrect on the post-lesson survey.  No more than eight students got any single question wrong.<br />

                <p>
                  Table 5 shows the difference in the average scores between the pre and post-lesson surveys.   The average score in the Pre-lesson survey was 7.9 points and the average on the post-lesson survey was 9.74 points.<br />

                  <h4>Discussion</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The data shows that the students had some prior knowledge about the topic of citation and research.  Based on questions asked during the discussion I discovered that one of the concepts, wikipedia is not a source itself but can lead them to good sources, had been covered in a previous class.  I also overheard students make the comment ‚ÄúMLA is the same as Chicago Style right?‚Äù  It was not a topic I had anticipated covering in the lesson but the misconception had to be corrected.  I do not believe that APA format was not a topic they had ever been introduced to since almost every student had question 1 incorrect on the pre-lesson survey.  On the post-lesson survey it is evident that the students had a good understanding that APA is used in all scientific writings since for question 1 only one student marked the wrong answer.  Another question with a large improvement was question 5 that asked about a rule specific to APA format.  I expected this result since the students had never been exposed to scientific writing before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students were stumped by question 3 throughout the lesson.  It asked them to choose which websites were the best to use for research and some still choose .com and .net as good options.  This is concerning since it was explicitly covered during the discussion.  It could have been that the lesson was too fast and they did not understand why those were not reliable sources.  The only question more students were wrong more often on the post-lesson survey was question 6.  I did not explicitly say you have to cite the source not matter how little information you could find.  An improvement on the lesson would be to teach the students methods for finding the information if it not obvious.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If I were to teach the lesson again I would like to have the students work with a partner or complete some example citations.  I would also place this lesson with a research based project so the students could apply the lesson immediately.  When this lesson was taught the class was designing experiments and if they were using someone else‚Äôs design, then it should be cited. I would also like to use this lesson to impart on the students the importance of science being based on evidence and that evidence can come from experiments you perform yourself or from someone else‚Äôs experiment.  However, if they use someone else‚Äôs data it must be cited.  I was only able to touch on the subject during this lesson.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <ol style='list-style-type: upper-roman;'>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Procedure:</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <i>Engagement</i>: First, I will review with the students the proper way to handle and use a microscope and slides.  I will ask the students, as a class, to list all the proper and safe ways to move and set the microscope.  Next I will ask the students what they know about cells; their structure, what‚Äôs in them, and why are cells important?  Then, I will ask them what they want to know and fill in a K-W-L chart on the overhead.  I will use a pattern to call on the students to make sure that everyone is participating.  (10 minutes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Exploration</i>: Students will work with their lab partners to observe and draw the cells they observe.  They will then be asked to state what is similar and what is different.  They will also be asked to propose why the cells look the way they do. (20 minutes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Explain</i>: I will bring the class back together to have a group discussion about what they saw on the slides.  By interjecting questions such as ‚ÄúWhat about the cell you looked at supports your hypothesis?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did you come up with that hypothesis?‚Äù  I will also ask them to share their predictions about why the cells have their particular structures.  By interjecting questions such as ‚ÄúWhat about the cell you looked at supports your hypothesis?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did you come up with that hypothesis?‚Äù the students will be forces to explain more about their thought process and describe what they observed.  Next, I will introduce terms and give them the functions of different organelles in the cells.  Some organelles I will ask the students to give their predictions on the function based on the name of the organelle.  (10 minutes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Elaboration</i>: The students will do a second handout with cartoon pictures of plant and animal cells.  They will have to label each organelle in the cells based on the functions I just introduced them to.  They will work with their partners and another pair to complete the labeling activity.  When labeling the structure they will have to explain why they think that organelle is the one they believe it is.  In the second part of the activity I will ask the students to make analogies for as many of the organelle functions as they can.  After a few minutes we will complete the picture as a class to ensure they have assigned the right name to the correct organelle in the picture.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <i>Evaluate/Assessment</i>: Formal:  The formal assessment will be at the end of the class when I bring the students back together to complete the KWL chart with what they learned, this is a cognitive assessment.  The analogies in the second activity will show who understands and will serve as an affective assessment.  I will also check their explanations for why they labeled each organelle what they did.<br />
                          Informal: I will be able to tell who is thinking about how the cell structure fits its function by the group discussion and the quality of responses.  Also, while walking around the room and listening to the conversations during group work will help me figure out who is working and thinking and who needs help.

                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      <h5>Differentiated Instruction:</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li><i>ELL Students</i>:  This less will be fine for ELL students since they are mostly working with their own observations and not reading.</li>
                        <li><i>Special Education</i>:  I will make a handout with the functions filled in for these students.</li>
                        <li><i>Talented and Gifted</i>:  For these students I will ask extra questions such as ‚ÄúWhat effect might this function have on the cells overall function?‚Äù</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Closure:</h5>
                      Completing the KWL chart and reviewing the pictures will bring closure and a final review of the main concepts and ideas for the day. (1 minute)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Differentiated Assessment</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Formal: The formal assessment will be the same.  I will still look to see if they assigned the correct names to the correct organelles, but I will not be looking for the why they think that.<br />
                  For the gifted students I will be looking for detailed and descriptive explanations citing their data and observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Informal: I will not expect the discussion to be as in depth as the other students, more basic and descriptive instead of having a lot of explanations.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Revisions</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will take note of what questions students had the most difficulty with and find another way to word the question to make the students think about the information.

                <p>
                  <i>Exploration:</i> The students will have most of the class to cut out and build their section of the membrane.  We will read through the directions together before they get started cutting and taping together their structure.  At the end the students will all put their membranes together to build a larger membrane.

                  <i>Explanation:</i> After, we will discuss how do scientists know what the outside of a membrane looks like?  We will talk about how science is based on observations and experiments.  I will ask the students ‚ÄúWhy is every section different?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho can describe what they see?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you think the proteins in the membrane can move?‚Äù

                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>ELL Students:</i> All notes and important concepts will be written on the board for them to copy down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Special Education Students:</i> If the student has a physical disability I will cut the difficult shapes out for them in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Gifted and Talented Students:</i> I will ask these students why the proteins are place in certain position on or in the membrane and why they think their location is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Closure:</i> I will have the students answer an exit ticket asking them to predict what goes through the proteins in the membrane.  This will serve as a bridge to the next days lesson about osmosis and diffusion.

                  <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did not think this activity was going to take as long as it did.  I estimated it would take about 10 minutes for everyone to build their parts of the membrane.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After reviewing with the students and introducing the topic for the day will be the cell membrane, I need to show more pictures or play a video to get them excited and engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When doing this activity with high school students I would make sure I have a pair of scissors for each student.  I would also build a model of the finished product.  It may also be helpful if I cut each of the proteins and the box out and lay them flat so the students know what each stage of the activity should look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With more time I would have been able to discuss many different nature of science concepts such as inference versus observation, empirical science, and subjective science.

                  <h4>Specific Learning Disabilities</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Definition</i>: A child is diagnosed with a specific learning disability when they are being instructed according to their age, or grade-level, standards but do not meet the state standards in one of the following areas:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Oral expression</li>
                    <li>Listening comprehension</li>
                    <li>Written expression</li>
                    <li>Basic reading skills</li>
                    <li>Reading fluency skills</li>
                    <li>Reading comprehension</li>
                    <li>Mathematics calculation</li>
                    <li>Mathematics problem solving</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A specific learning disability cannot be the result of another disability, cultural factors, socioeconomic status, or limited English skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Teaching Methods</i>: The strategy used to teach a student with a specific learning disability depends on the disability they have.  With any specific learning disability, the student must be given extra time to complete the assigned work.  Each disability type has special tasks that a teacher must do to help the student, for example, if the student has a reading comprehension disability the teacher has to help the student gather what they can from other information on the page such as pictures, headings, and graphs.  Assistive technology such as speech software or audio books can be brought into the classroom to further assist the students with disabilities
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Behavioral Characteristics</i>: Students with specific learning disabilities never act exactly the same as one another, therefor, there is a wide range of behaviors they exhibit including:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Poor motor skills</li>
                    <li>Low grades</li>
                    <li>Short attention span</li>
                    <li>Weak oral language skills</li>
                    <li>Problems with written language</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate social skills</li>
                    <li>Problems with mathematics</li>
                    <li>Difficulties reading</li>
                    <li>Slow development of cognitive strategies</li>
                    <li>Problems with information-processing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Other Health Impairments</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Definition:</i> Students with other health impairments have limited strength, vitality, or alertness that adversely affects the educational performance due to chronic or acute health problems such as: asthma, ADD, ADHD diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, leukemia, or sickle cell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Project Ideal ADHD is the most common disability in this category and will have the biggest impact in a classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Teaching Methods:</i> For students with ADHD have to be given extra time to switch their focus from one activity or location to another.  They also need to be taught techniques that help them organize their thoughts and materials.  A student with ADHD should be seated close to the teacher and have complex work broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.  It is also very important for a student with ADHD to have a structured schedule so they know what is coming next and understand what is expected of the during that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For students with other health impairments, such as asthma, diabetes, or epilepsy, it is important for a teacher to understand the severity of the student‚Äôs condition and what to do in an emergency.  The teacher also has to know about any medication the student may be taking, its impact on the student, and how to react in case of an emergency.  For example, a teacher has to know that if one of their students with epilepsy is having a seizure they need to move objects away so the student does not get hurt, they have to keep other students from crowding around, and that after a seizure a person should be turned onto their left side in case of vomiting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Behavioral Characteristics:</i> Students with ADHD have a hard time keeping their attention focused on a task.  They also do not pay attention to detail and make mistakes often.  ADHD students have difficulty with organization of activities and avoid activities that demand concentration or mental effort.  They tend to be forgetful, get distracted easily, and lose materials they need for assignments.  During class time the student may fidget in their seat, get up from their seat and roam the classroom, say the answer when they are not asked for it, and interrupt others.
